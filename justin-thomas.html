He also received a bonus of <strong>$4.5 Million </strong>from his PGA Tour Championship from the <i>2019-2020 </i>season. He currently maintains an impressive net worth of <strong>$30 Million, </strong>which is less than the current World No. 1 golfer, <a href=#><strong>Rory Mcilroy</strong></a>'s total fortune.</p><p>Apart from Thomas' golf career, he is actively working on endorsement deals with sponsors and brands like <i>Footjoy, Netjets, WHOOP,</i> and many more. He also featured in the commercial ads with <i>Scotty Cameron, Titleist, Footjoy</i>, etc. So, he probably earned a good sum of paycheque from his partnerships with popular brands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/6/13/4-1623607723838.jpg><p>On the other side, Thomas is a philanthropist as well. His financial contribution to rising talent in golf, <strong>Mike Visacki</strong> put him in the spotlight on <i>2nd June 2021</i>. The story behind the generous help is Visacki's successful qualification for his first PGA Tour championship, which made him emotional. However, Justin kept his <a href=# rel=nofollow>signing amount</a> a secret up until now.</p><h2>Faced Criticism Over Insulting with Homophobic Slur</h2><p>Former World's No. 1 golfer, Thomas was in shame of thrust when he was found using the slang word, "faggot," during the Sentry Tournament of Champions' 3rd round in Hawaii on <i>9th January 2021</i>. After finding him guilty via a TV microphone by the operator, he was out of the <strong>$6.7 Million</strong> golf event, and many people raise finger at him after discriminating against gay rights.</p><p>After a few days of the incident, Justin faced the allegation of overusing the homophobic slur and said, "there was no absolute intention for him to say anything which discriminate anyone's gender rights and it is not the kind of person that he is trying to be." Also, he proclaimed, "he need to do better and he is deeply apologize to everyone or anyone who got offended."</p><p>On <i>16th January 2021</i>, Justin's sponsorship with a worldwide popular clothing brand, Ralph Lauren terminated following the criticism of using homophobic slang. Moreover, Ralph Lauren said, "it was absolutely disheartened by using a language that entirely inconsistent with their values. And, Thomas does the hard and necessary work in order to partner with them again." In response, the <i>2017</i> PGA Tour champion said that "<a href=# rel=nofollow>It's inexcusable </a>for him."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h2>Who is Justin Thomas' Girlfriend? Are They Planning To Get Married?</h2><p>The <i>28-years old,</i> Justin has been in a romantic relationship with <strong>Jillian Wisniewski</strong>, a senior business manager for advertising agency company, <i>McGarryBowen </i>since <i>2015</i>. The couple met for the first time in <i>2016</i> and in a short period of time, they began dating.</p><p>Do you know? Thomas' girlfriend is a native of Kentucky.&nbsp;Moreover, she is an alumnus of the University of Kentucky and holds a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Journalism degree since <i>2015</i>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/6/7/the%20spun%20(1)-1623083192976.jpg><p>During the victory of PGA Tour <i>2017</i>, John's girlfriend was there for Thomas, but she was supposed to take a flight for some serious work at the time. However, she changed her decision at the last minute of her flight take-off after changing the time of her flight when Thomas played the winning performance.</p><p>During a press conference, Jillian states that she is forever on her partner's side and tries as much as possible to be with him during his critical moments. In an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow><i><strong>The Sun</strong></i></a>, Justin said, "Once she almost missed his first major victory as she had plans to leave before the game ended due to her flight at around 7 p.m. Nonetheless, she stayed in cheering up for him.</p><h2>A Glance of Justin Thomas' Early Life</h2><p>Jillian Wisniewski's girlfriend, Thomas celebrated his 28th birthday on the 29th of April 2021, as per his birth year, <i>1993</i>. Moreover, his parents, <strong>Mike Thomas</strong> and <strong>Jani Thomas</strong> and raised him in a friendly environment in Louisville, Kentucky, USA<i>.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>Thomas' dad, Mike is still the head professional at the Harmony Landing Country Club for more than four decades since <i>1990.</i> Meanwhile, his grandfather played as the head professional at Zanesville Country Club for over 25 years. So, it seems like Justin is leading the legacy of his father and grandfather.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/6/7/jani%20thomas%20(1)-1623083779002.jpeg><p>During Thomas' high school days, he became the 3rd youngest golfer, who played in the PGA Tour's Wyndham Championship.
