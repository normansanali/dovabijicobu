Kim Kardashian's friend <a href=#>Jonathan Cheban, AKA Foodgod,</a> made frequent appearances on KUTWK. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephanie Shepherd used to be Kim Kardashian's assistant</a>, and she still hangs out with Kim and Kourtney often. It is also well known that Malika and Khadijah Haqq have been best friends with Khloe Kardashian for years. They have been well-integrated into the family, and they have been there for Khloe through all of her ups and downs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How Did Jonathan Cheban Become Best Friends With Kim Kardashian?">How Did Jonathan Cheban Become Best Friends With Kim Kardashian?</a></span></p><p>Not only are the Kar-Jenners' friendships public knowledge, but their friendship break-ups are as well. The <a href=#>infidelity scandal</a> involving Khloe Kardashian, Tristan Thompson, and Kylie Jenner's ex-best friend Jordyn Woods was the subject of many headlines for months. Ex-family friend <a href=#>Larsa Pippen's drama with the Kardashian sisters</a> was well publicized throughout 2020 and 2021. The evolution of Kim's relationship with Blac Chyna has been no different. OG KUWTK fans will remember that Blac Chyna was friends with Kim Kardashian pre-Rob Kardashian. However, relationship drama has turned them into legal rivals.</p><h2 id=blac-chyna-and-kim-kardashian-used-to-be-good-friends><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Blac Chyna And Kim Kardashian Used To Be Good Friends</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you watch older episodes of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, you may be shocked to see Blac Chyna pop up on your screen. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blac Chyna and Kim Kardashian were actually friends</a> all the way back in 2013 - before Kim's marriage to Kanye and Blac Chyna's tumultuous relationship with Rob Kardashian. They could be spotted on each other's social media, working out, and even getting their brows done together.</p><h2 id=blac-chyna-and-tyga-attended-kimye-rsquo-s-wedding-in-may-2014><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Blac Chyna And Tyga Attended Kimyeâ€™s Wedding In May 2014</span></h2><p>Blac Chyna and Kim Kardashian used to be so close that Blac Chyna was one of the guests at Kim and Kanye's wedding in Italy. Blac Chyna went with then boyfriend and baby daddy Tyga as her guest. In hindsight, this date may have marked the beginning of the end for Chyna and Tyga as he started dating Kim's little sister Kylie just months later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Kris Jenner Says Blac Chyna Threatened To Kill Kylie ">Kris Jenner Says Blac Chyna Threatened To Kill Kylie</a></span></p><h2 id=tyga-and-kylie-got-together-in-july-2014><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Tyga And Kylie Got Together In July 2014</span></h2><p>After Chyna brought Tyga to then-bestie Kim's wedding in May 2014, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyga was featured on Kylie Jenner's Instagram</a> in July 2014. Tyga then announced the end of his engagement to Blac Chyna. Kyga was Instagram-official by October 2014. <a href=#>Blac Chyna accused Kylie of stealing Tyga</a> from her, which likely put a strain on her friendship with Kim Kardashian.</p><h2 id=rob-kardashian-and-blac-chyna-started-dating-in-january-2016><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Rob Kardashian And Blac Chyna Started Dating In January 2016</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim Kardashian's brother, Rob, started dating his little sister's boyfriend's baby mama in January 2016. Within a few months, Rob and Blac Chyna were reportedly engaged and expecting. Their daughter, Dream, was born in November 2016. However, despite the fast timeline of their relationship, the couple's relationship was nowhere near perfect. They broke up multiple times over the course of their relationship, and their arguments were often explosive.</p><h2 id=rob-kardashian-and-blac-chyna-39-s-show-aired-in-september-2016><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Rob Kardashian And Blac Chyna's Show Aired In September 2016</span></h2><p>The ups and downs of Rob and Chyna's relationship were put on full display on the couple's reality show Rob & Chyna. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">show aired until December 2016</a> and was even renewed for a second season. On the show, the couple fought over virtually everything from french fries to family. The series also showcased Rob's fitness journey and Chyna's pregnancy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Blac Chyna Allegedly Assaulted One Of Kylie's Exes ">Blac Chyna Allegedly Assaulted One Of Kylie's Exes</a></span></p><h2 id=blac-chyna-and-rob-kardashian-broke-up-in-mid-2017><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Blac Chyna And Rob Kardashian Broke Up In Mid-2017</span></h2><p>In 2017, Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian went their separate ways for the last time. After their relationship ended, Rob filed a lawsuit accusing Blac Chyna of assaulting him on December 14, 2016. He alleged that Chyna attacked him at Kylie Jenner's home while they were celebrating the renewal of their reality show. Since there was now legal trouble between the families, whatever friendship Kim had with Chyna was probably gone. Rob didn't drop the suit until this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blac-chyna-also-sued-rob-kardashian><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Blac Chyna Also Sued Rob Kardashian</span></h2><p>Blac Chyna then sued Rob for posting her nude pictures on Instagram after their break-up. Last month, Blac Chyna chose to settle with Rob instead of taking him to court. Though the amount for the settlement is unknown, it is good that exes are no longer fighting each other in court and can hopefully focus on co-parenting their daughter instead.</p><h2 id=blac-chyna-recently-faced-ex-friend-kim-kardashian-in-court><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Blac Chyna Recently Faced Ex-Friend Kim Kardashian In Court</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim Kardashian clearly places her family above any friendship. Kim recently faced Blac Chyna in court, along with Kris Jenner, Kylie Jenner, and Khloe Kardashian. Blac Chyna was finally able to take the Kar-Jenners to court after <a href=#>suing them for defamation in 2017.</a> Chyna accused the family of telling E! producers that she abused Rob Kardashian to get Rob & Chyna canceled. The <a href=#>jury sided with the Kar-Jenners</a>, but Chyna plans to appeal the verdict.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecqipGajkaexor%2FHopinZZGjsW6uy5qaZpuYrruiecaoZJ%2Bqn6J6p77InqWdq12pvG6xzZ6kop2jZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./i-never-said-this-vincent-donofrio-clears-up-a-misconception-about-a-spider-man-confrontation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="I never said this: Vincent DOnofrio clears up a misconception about a Spider-Man confrontat">&larr;
