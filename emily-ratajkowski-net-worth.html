England-born American model, author, and actress Emily Ratajkowski’s net worth as of December 2023 is a whopping <strong>$8 million</strong>.</p><p>Her fortune can be primarily attributed to her modeling gigs, acting, endorsement deals, social media sponsorships, book sales, and royalties, and investments.</p><p>Emily became famous practically overnight after appearing in Robin Thicke’s music video for “Blurred Lines” in 2013.</p><p>Even though she began her career in acting, she eventually discovered her knack for modeling when she was only 14 and has since worked in the fashion industry, primarily in New City and Los Angeles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Prince appropriated Emily’s posts from Instagram without her consent and showcased them as paintings at the Gagosian Gallery in New York.</p><p>Ratajkowski made a smart move with this seven years later, and instead of filing a lawsuit, she took a picture of herself in front of the painting and created a non-fungible token (NFT) from it.</p><p>The NFT fetched a whopping
