It is <b>a gun owned by Martin Harris</b>, that he brought to the basement the day before Kate Wallis was rescued by the police.</strong></p><p>For instance, Who is Ben in Cruel Summer? Nathaniel Ashton as Ben Hallowell</p><p>He’s a relative newcomer to acting, with Cruel Summer being his most well-known role so far.</p><p>Did Mallory see Kate? One of the driving plot points behind Cruel Summer season 1 was that Kate accused Jeanette of seeing her at Martin’s house, but the finale revealed that it was actually Mallory who saw her.</p><p>Besides, Did Jeanette see Kate?</p><p>Jeanette did see Kate in the basement, but there’s a reason why she didn’t tell anyone.</p><p>Beside above, What’s with the snow globe in Cruel Summer?</p><p>It is a Winter wonderland themed globe which Martin Harris purchased for the 1993 Christmas celebration. The snow globe was later stolen by Jeanette Turner and given to Mallory Higgins. The globe was heard in the background of a voicemail that Kate Wallis left for Jamie Henson on Christmas Eve of 1993.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_old_is_Mallory_Cruel_Summer></span><strong>How old is Mallory Cruel Summer?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Online, the 21-year-old has been a vocal champion of the show, with most of her recent Instagram posts dedicated to promoting the project which is so close to her heart. And it’s not just that she loves Cruel Summer itself, but that she found something truly special in the role of Mallory Higgins.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_old_are_the_kids_in_Cruel_Summer></span><strong>How old are the kids in Cruel Summer?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The story of a teenage girl’s disappearance in the ’90s — and the devastating fallout it has on her classmates and the community at large — is mostly told while the characters are between 15 and 18 years old, but like most high-school shows, the cast members are several years older.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_lying_Kate_or_Jeanette></span><strong>Who is lying Kate or Jeanette?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While some viewers might feel like some of the weight of that reconciliation is lost when it’s later revealed that Jeanette was still lying to Kate and the world, Napolitano sees it as a valuable moment that shows how far the two teenage girls have come. “They’ve both learned so much,” she said.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_Kate_get_Jeanette_necklace></span><strong>How did Kate get Jeanette necklace?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On December 24, 1993, Jeanette broke into Martin’s house once more and stole a snow globe. She heard creaking floorboards from the floor above her and panicked. She ran out of the house and unknowingly dropped her necklace. Kate, who had free reign of the house, picked up the necklace.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Kate_forgive_Jeanette></span><strong>Does Kate forgive Jeanette?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>First, the journalist on whose show Kate first made the slanderous accusation has Jeanette on in order to apologize to her. Mirroring Kate’s accusation, Jeannette says she forgives her – but in the exact way where you can tell she definitely does not forgive her, and is out for revenge.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_Kate_get_Jeanette%E2%80%99s_necklace></span><strong>How did Kate get Jeanette’s necklace?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On December 24, 1993, Jeanette broke into Martin’s house once more and stole a snow globe. She heard creaking floorboards from the floor above her and panicked. She ran out of the house and unknowingly dropped her necklace. Kate, who had free reign of the house, picked up the necklace.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_did_Martin_see_on_the_tape_Cruel_Summer></span><strong>What did Martin see on the tape Cruel Summer?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>What Martin Sees On Mallory’s Prank Video Tape. As part of their summer pranks list which was started by Mallory (Harley Quinn Smith) in 1993, we see the trio — completed by Vince (Allius Barnes) — putting on a show for their classmates on the first day of school.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_actually_saw_Kate_in_Cruel_Summer></span><strong>Who actually saw Kate in Cruel Summer?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The truth was finally revealed during Cruel Summer’s season finale, but not without one final surprise twist. During a face-to-face chat inside Martin’s home, Jeanette and Kate came to the realization that it was actually Mallory whom Kate thought had seen her.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_was_on_the_prank_tape_on_Cruel_Summer></span><strong>What was on the prank tape on Cruel Summer?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In Cruel Summer, Jamie explained that the tape is a voicemail from Christmas Eve of 1993, only a few months after Kate went missing. When he played the strange recording, Jeanette heard breathing and a song playing in the background. The voicemail shook her, and she ran out of Jamie’s garage.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_did_Mr_Harris_see_on_the_tape_in_Cruel_Summer></span><strong>What did Mr Harris see on the tape in Cruel Summer?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The existence of the videotape proves to be unsettling for Jeanette and for Kate’s kidnapper, Martin Harris (Blake Lee). When the Assistant Principal watches it, he sees something that could derail his entire plan for Kate.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_long_was_Kate_missing_in_Cruel_Summer></span><strong>How long was Kate missing in Cruel Summer?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 1994, Kate has been missing for a year, and the now-popular Jeanette celebrates her birthday with her now-boyfriend Jamie and Kate’s former friends.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_Kate_blame_Jeanette></span><strong>Why did Kate blame Jeanette?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>During a TV interview, Kate claimed that Jeanette saw her in Martin Harris’ basement (which was where she was held captive). She accused Jeanette of keeping this information secret, which allowed the assistant principal to continue to keep Kate away from her family and friends.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Jeanette_hear_Kate></span><strong>Did Jeanette hear Kate?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>So it would appear that Jeanette was being honest… about not having seen Kate while she was being held captive. A chilling final scene revealed that she did, however, hear Kate begging for help from behind the basement door when she broke into the house again in 1994!</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_Jeanette_not_save_Kate></span><strong>Why did Jeanette not save Kate?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Much of Cruel Summer’s power has come from its dissection of the societal pressures put on young women, and how their decisions are shaped by those forces. According to the showrunner, the reveal that Jeanette left Kate to suffer in Martin’s basement for what Napolitano told us was “months” fits into that.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Cruel_Summer_on_Netflix></span><strong>Is Cruel Summer on Netflix?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The first season is now available to stream courtesy of Freeform and Hulu. Episodes are also ready to purchase on Amazon Prime Video. However, it is not on Netflix.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Kate%E2%80%99s_dad_in_Cruel_Summer></span><strong>Who is Kate’s dad in Cruel Summer?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rod Wallis is a recurring character in the Freeform series Cruel Summer. Handsome, charismatic and former professional football player, Rod is Kate’s stepfather. He is an empathetic father whose parenting skills are tested over the course of three, complicated, painful years.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_happened_to_Jeannette%E2%80%99s_mom_on_Cruel_Summer></span><strong>What happened to Jeannette’s mom on Cruel Summer?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The 1995 footage in Cruel Summer shows that Cindy, Jeanette’s mom, isn’t living with the family anymore. Something likely happened between Cindy and Jeanette’s dad, Greg, and it’s definitely over Jeanette’s involvement (in whatever capacity that may be) with Kate’s abduction, but we don’t know the details just yet.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_long_was_Kate_in_the_basement></span><strong>How long was Kate in the basement?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kate leaves Martin’s house after his death on June 21, 1994. Kate was missing for just about ten months. For the first four months, she slept in the same bed as Martin and roamed his house freely. For the last six months, she was locked in his basement.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_happened_to_Jeanette%E2%80%99s_mom_in_Cruel_Summer></span><strong>What happened to Jeanette’s mom in Cruel Summer?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The 1995 footage in Cruel Summer shows that Cindy, Jeanette’s mom, isn’t living with the family anymore. Something likely happened between Cindy and Jeanette’s dad, Greg, and it’s definitely over Jeanette’s involvement (in whatever capacity that may be) with Kate’s abduction, but we don’t know the details just yet.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_sent_the_liar_letter_in_Cruel_Summer></span><strong>Who sent the liar letter in Cruel Summer?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kate discovered that her mother was the one who sent her the letter calling her a “liar.” At the end of the episode, viewers watched Derek Turner (Barrett Carnahan) discover the chat between Ashley Wallis (Ashlei Sharpe Chestnut) and Kate. He quickly printed the discussion and gave it to Jeanette.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_did_Martin_do_to_Kate></span><strong>What did Martin do to Kate?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Entrapped by his grooming, manipulation, love bombing, isolation, and lies, Kate was abused by Martin and kept in his house as in a twisted facsimile of love. She thought she was there by choice, and he tightly controlled every choice that she made.</p><h3></h3><h3><strong></strong></h3><h2><strong></strong></h2><h2><strong></strong></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbBnnp1kxKm7jKKqZpmeo66jsculnGahnmKws8HEpWSsrZ2isrN7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-carolyn-bryant-donham-where-is-she-now-wikipedia-bio-age-341061-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Carolyn Bryant Donham  Where Is She Now?
