popular gamer and YouTube personality known for his vlogs, where he shares all kinds of gaming videos, sometimes collaborating with other known gamers to create his outstanding content.&nbsp;Ohmwrecker has built a reputation as one of the most creative and trusted content creators on YouTube and Twitch.&nbsp;He has over a million followers on his social media accounts.</span></p><p><span>Since creating his channel in 2006, Ohmwrecker has gone from another gamer to one of the most popular online personalities.&nbsp;Over the past 10 years, he has grown his fanbase and garnered a gigantic clientele that has allowed him to build a career and earn a lot of money doing what he loves.&nbsp;In fact, his brand has taken such a leap forward that his channel is now one of YouTube’s verified partners.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Ohmwrecker Bio (Age and real name)</span></strong></h2><p><span>The famous vlogger was born on June 28, 1983 in Chicago, Illinois.&nbsp;His real name is Ryan, however, his last name is unknown.&nbsp;The player is very conservative when revealing details regarding his personal life that could reveal his true identity.&nbsp;Ohmwrecker revealed he didn’t have the easiest time growing up.&nbsp;Her parents weren’t on the best of terms, as they had a messy marriage and divorce that caused them to neglect their children.&nbsp;After the situation got too tense, he left home as a teenager and had to live on the streets for a while.</span></p><p><span>Ryan eventually left school, although he later returned to complete his education after becoming rich and famous.&nbsp;He graduated from university in 2013, in business administration.&nbsp;Ohmwrecker started his career in 2006 after joining YouTube and Twitch, where he started posting his gaming videos.&nbsp;It started with Let’s Play videos like Command and Conquer, Bioshock, and Battlefield.&nbsp;Ohmwrecker’s videos started to get really popular and pretty soon he started gaining followers by the thousands.&nbsp;He then started sharing videos of other games like Rainbow Six: Siege, Garry’s Mod, Dead by Daylight, etc.</span></p><p><span>As his fame grew, he started collaborating with other popular players on YouTube to create more fantastic content.&nbsp;He has worked with gaming personalities like H2O Delirious, I AM Wildcat, CaRt0oNz, VanossGaming, Bryce McQuaid and Daithi De Nogla.&nbsp;It has also started developing its brand and image to explore more opportunities in the digital space and beyond.&nbsp;Ohmwrecker makes a huge amount of money from his YouTube videos which get millions of views.&nbsp;The YouTuber also has his own merchandise line where he sells t-shirts, caps, hoodies and other accessories that his fans love to spend their money on.&nbsp;The famous player is a partner of Twitch and has nearly 200,000 followers on his platform.</span></p><p><span>The professional gamer has been involved in beta testing for numerous games such as League of Legends, in which he received an item bearing his name for earning over a thousand referrals.&nbsp;It has also partnered with Curse.&nbsp;He is loved by his fans and followers for his upbeat attitude and the positive messages he often incorporates into his live streams and videos.&nbsp;Ohmwrecker has received several accolades for his work, including a 2017 Teen Choice Awards for Gamer’s Choice.</span></p><h2><strong><span>What does it look like?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Despite the fact that Ohmwrecker has built an impressive career for himself from the start, very few people know what he looks like in real life.&nbsp;The player is yet to show his true face or identity to his followers.&nbsp;Ryan shared some details that give an idea of ​​who he is, such as his hair color, which is brown.&nbsp;He described his eyes as hazel which sometimes look blue or green.&nbsp;He also said he was 5ft 11in tall with a trimmed beard.</span></p><p><span>Another clue as to his identity was revealed when he shared his ethnicity, saying his father was Polish and his mother was Italian.&nbsp;Ohmwrecker usually wears a mask or some other form of disguise in his videos, which makes it hard to tell what he really looks like, so you might hardly recognize him if he walks past you in public.&nbsp;Maybe one day he would trust the public with his true identity and reveal himself to us.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Ohmwrecker’s Girlfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>Ohmwrecker has managed to keep his personal life under wraps, including his status and relationship history.&nbsp;If he’s dating someone right now, the player is doing a good job of keeping it a secret.&nbsp;It is possible that he is single and only focused on his career at the moment.</span></p><p class=postsid
