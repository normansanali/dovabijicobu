The couples are believed to be the current leaders of the group, with Jay Z being the king and Beyoncé the queen .&nbsp;Accusations and counter-accusations come from all directions that both men are working extra hours to recruit unsuspecting members of the public who subscribe to their beliefs.</span></p><p><span>The two are believed to run the organization and control the global entertainment industry, politics, and finance, among other things.&nbsp;Based on some confessions from disgruntled members, it’s likely that the allegations are true and that the two aren’t human, as one might think.&nbsp;As you may know, Beyoncé is a singer, songwriter, model, and actress.&nbsp;She would have used her talent to promote the occult activities of the group.</span></p><h2><span>Beyoncé’s religion</span></h2><p><span>All of his songs, according to conspiracy theorists have hidden meanings which mostly insult Christianity and promote satanic activities.&nbsp;These theories are believable, especially when you break down the song lyrics or read them backwards.&nbsp;Every time Beyoncé makes a video of her songs, the keen eyes of someone familiar with Illuminati symbolism won’t help but see many occult symbols.&nbsp;His poses, facial expressions, and staging reveal a certain pattern that can be associated with the occult organization.</span></p><p><span>One of the most common symbols associated with Illuminati is a one-eyed pyramid.&nbsp;It is also the symbol of Freemasonry.&nbsp;Most people believe that there are very close ties between the two secret organizations.&nbsp;Beyoncé has been seen several times performing on a stage bearing the symbol.&nbsp;Plus, she’s used to doing the pyramid with her hands over one eye.&nbsp;It is therefore not surprising that all members of the government join the group and that they generally eliminate the symbols at will, indicating their affiliation with the satanic organization.</span></p><p><span>One of her most controversial events is her claim that she was born again.&nbsp;It can only mean that her old man was gone and she became a new person.&nbsp;Many people now believe that Beyoncé was baptized enlightenment and became a full member.&nbsp;Other songs she wrote speak volumes about this change.&nbsp;Her marriage to Jay Z is also seen as another step taken by the secret organization to strengthen itself.</span></p><p><span>To top it off, Beyoncé’s so-called baby girl Blue Ivy Carter would be the true face of evil.&nbsp;Conspiracy theorists believe the name choice was no coincidence;&nbsp;it actually has a hidden meaning.&nbsp;They think Blue Ivy is the code for Born Living Under Evil, the youngest of the Illuminati.&nbsp;It may have dug so deep, but it’s not out of place for me to think the same way.&nbsp;How the hell did they think of such a name?&nbsp;It certainly means something.</span></p><p><span>To sum up, there is compelling evidence to believe that Beyoncé is actually Queen of the Illuminati and that her religion is Satanism.&nbsp;She has openly decided to turn her back on Christianity and now seems to be working more time promoting satanic activities that will culminate in the New World Order.&nbsp;That’s according to the conspirators.&nbsp;All we can do is wait with bated breath to see what she will achieve.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiala68r6%2FEZqClpKWitq%2Bt06Jkq52cnrSqu81o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./luvpres.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Facts, Single">&larr;
