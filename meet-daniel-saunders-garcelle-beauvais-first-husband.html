Get to know RHOBH star Garcelle’s first husband, Daniel Saunders, in the article below.</p><h3><strong>Meet RHOBH Star Garcelle Beauvais First Husband, Daniel Saunders</strong></h3><p>Garcelle Beauvais met her first husband Daniel Saunders when she was modeling in New York. The two immediately fell in love once they saw each other. Two months later, they got married. The couple was married from 1991 to 2000.</p><p>Sometime in 1991, the couple also gave birth to a boy, Oliver Saunders. Reportedly, Garcelle took her baby boy with her anywhere she went—on photo shoots, on location, and on airplanes as well.</p><p>Although Oliver acted in some TV shows as a child, he had his heart set to become a rapper from a young age. Oliver entered the Hip-Hop industry and started making music under the moniker Jayson Rose.</p><p>“Blunts and Starbucks” was Oliver’s debut mixtape. He has opened for The Roots’ Questlove and shared stages with Talib Kweli, 9th Wonder, and Dom Kennedy.</p><p>Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Oliver tied knots with his longtime girlfriend Samantha Saunders. Garcelle broke the joyous news as she congratulated the couple on their marriage.</p><p>A month before the wedding, Oliver and Sam had welcomed a son named Oliver Jr. By the time they tied the knot, they were parenting four children already.</p><h3><strong>Is Daniel Saunders Married Today?</strong></h3><p>As of August 2022, we did not know if Daniel Saunders was married to anybody. His relationship status seems to be unclear.</p><p>It looked like Daniel’s ex-wife Garcelle Beauvais was single in 2022. She and her boyfriend Michale Elliot, a writer best known for screenplays for films like Just Wright, Brown Sugar, and Like Mike, called it quits in February 2020 after dating for several months.</p><p>In the year 2000, after Garcelle separated from Daniel, she found love with producer and manager Mike Nilon. Garcelle and Daniel had many infertility problems and after five years of treatment, they have birth to twins Jax Joseph Nilon and Jaid Thomas Nilon in 2007.</p><p>After nine years of happy marriage, Garcelle filed for divorce as she found out that her husband was cheating on her with his co-worker for five years.</p><p>One morning when Garcelle was using Mike’s phone to call her mom, she found a text from Mike’s co-worker saying “I love you.” After she found out he was cheating on her, she exposed his affair in an email that she sent to his coworkers with the title “What [do] Tiger Woods, Jesse James, and Mike Nilon have in common?”</p><p>However, in an interview many years later, Garcelle revealed that she regrets acting so childishly in anger and fury. The former couple is on good terms these days though as they co-parent their twin sons.</p><h3><strong>Daniel Saunders Age</strong></h3><p>Daniel Saunders was reportedly born in the year 1963, thus his age was 58 as of this writing in 2022. Also, Daniel celebrates his birthday every September 3rd. His son Oliver wished him on his 58th birthday making an Instagram post.</p><h3><strong>Daniel Saunders Job</strong></h3><p>Unlike his ex-wife Garcelle Beauvais, Daniel’s job details are not publicly found on the Internet.

Garcelle joined the cast of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills as the show’s first black cast member during its tenth season.</p><p>Recently, in 2017, she played the role of Doris Toomes, wife of Michael Keaton’s character Adrian Toomes in Spider-Man: Homecoming.</p><p>Garcelle also owns a children’s jewelry line called Petit Bijou. As an author, she has published a book titled I Am Mixed, which tells the story of twins.
