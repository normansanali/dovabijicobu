In addition to running their fixer-upper empire, <a href=#>Chip and Joanna Gaines are raising five kids together</a>, which is a job all on its own.</p><p>Clearly, <a href=#>the Gaineses have a lot going on, including burnout for both Gaineses and an old back injury for Joanna</a>.

Calling Chip "off the rails" in newer episodes, a fan wrote that Joanna "didn't seem to enjoy his antics anymore."</p><p>Others agreed that the newer shows with Chip and Joanna — including the special The Castle — seemed like Chip was trying too hard and that the couple was "not genuine anymore."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Various other comments agreed that the dynamic between the two was "hard to watch."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chip-joanna-gaines-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Chip And Joanna Gaines' Multi-Million Dollar Lawsuit May Be Their Biggest Scandal That Fixer Upper Fans Know Nothing About</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Fixer Upper stars Chip and Joanna Gaines have done incredibly well with their Magnolia brand, but they were sued in 2022 for a surprising reason.</span><p>There could be some truth to viewers' observations that things were "off" at one point; <a href=#>Chip admitted that becoming famous was "sad" for him for a time</a>. That tracks with fans' sum-up of interviews with Chip where he claimed that producers wanted him to always be on and funny, with quips and one-liners ever-ready.</p><p>On the opposite side of the spectrum, many viewers defended Chip and Joanna, saying that they "literally run an empire now," suggesting that most of their public-facing relationship is "business like and professional" versus "spouses" in many cases.</p><p>That doesn't mean there's trouble in paradise, however.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-chip-and-joanna-gaines-still-married>Are Chip And Joanna Gaines Still Married?</h2><h3 id=some-fans-suspect-that-chip-and-joanna-were-having-marriage-problems>Some fans suspect that Chip and Joanna were having marriage problems</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/5ac4dcfd10d6bb27008b4586.jpg><p>Despite their suspicions about Chip and Joanna Gaines' marriage, fans don't have any proof that the reality TV couple is anything but happy together.
