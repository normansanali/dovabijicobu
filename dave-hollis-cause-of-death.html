In his role as Disney’s worldwide distribution president from 2011 to 2018, Dave oversaw the release of several blockbuster films, including Black Panther, Moana, and several Star Wars installments.</p><p>Dave had only days left till his 47th birthday when he passed away. Hearing this came as a surprise because she appeared to be in good health. Now, what exactly caused Dave’s demise? This is what we know at this time.</p><h2>Dave Hollis Cause of Death</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Dave-Hollis.jpg><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Variety initially broke the news</a>, and while the circumstances surrounding his passing are still unclear, they do remain mysterious. But “had lately been hospitalized for heart-related health issues,” as Dave put it.</p><p>Dave became well-known on social media before she became an author (Rachel Hollis, New York Times Best Seller Girl, Wash Your Face) since he was a high-ranking executive at Disney and had married a prominent influencer.</p><p>Dave and Rachel moved from Los Angeles to Austin so that David could assist run Rachel’s company, formerly known as Chic Media but now known as The Hollis Company. Dave and Rachel’s podcast about their marriage, Rising Together, was very successful.</p><p>Rachel and Dave’s careers were so entwined that<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> their decision to divorce</a> was shocking to everyone.</p><p><strong>In the summer of 2020, Rachel broke the news on Instagram:</strong></p><p>Guys, I have some hard news to share… Dave and I have made the incredibly difficult decision to end our marriage.We started out as best friends 18 years ago and the truth is, that core friendship and the parts of us that work so well, have become a band-aid for the parts of us that don’t.</p><p>We have worked endlessly over the last three years to make this work and have come to the conclusion that it is healthier and more respectful for us to choose this as the end of our journey as a married couple. We remain dear friends as we raise our family as co-parents and run our company as partners…</p><p>Together, Rachel and Dave raised their four kids, Ford, Jackson, Sawyer, and Noah.</p><p><strong>Check out other famous celebrities’ cause of death we have covered on our site:</strong></p><p>In a piece from last December, David discussed observing the holidays after his divorce</p><p>“Extreme behavior often follows a divorce. When a couple has just divorced, the holidays tend to get a little rowdy. We break from our usual every-other-week schedule to allow ourselves each two weeks off before and after Christmas for visits with loved ones. It’s Rae’s turn to speak first, then it’s my turn. Thus, it is the final day I’ll see this group till after the holidays “</p><p>Rachel published a brief Instagram post after hearing the news of Dave’s death, despite the fact that the two remained close till the end. Article text: “We can’t believe it. My heart is too devastated right now to find the words to express how I feel. While we try to figure out how to deal with the unthinkable, please keep the kids in your thoughts and prayers.”</p><p>We want to express our deepest condolences to the Hollis family for their tragic loss; we know that he will be sorely missed by many.</p><p>You can also visit our site <a href=# rel=noopener>venturejolt.com</a> to read more about the deaths of famous people and the circumstances surrounding their passing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdgaHxxhY6dmK%2BdXZ28rbjIrGScmaWosm67xWabnpmknXw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./307506-g-herbo-and-taina-williams-dress-up-as-jay-z-and-beyonc-for-halloween-news.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="G Herbo &amp;amp; Taina Williams Dress Up As Jay-Z &amp;amp; Beyonc For Halloween">&larr;
