While the contestants are screened and the show experts claim they select only people who want a healthy relationship, a few participants inevitably derail the experiment. Partners have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cheated on their significant others</a>, lied about their intentions, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">developed toxic relationships on screen</a>. Though a few couples have managed to last past the final filming date, the majority (surprise!) cannot keep their marriages from falling apart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even with all the drama that has taken place in past seasons, Australia’s most recent season of Married at First Sight was arguably its most shocking; two contestants, Stacey Hampton and Mikey Pembroke, reportedly cheated on their spouses with each other during filming. And that very same drama that kept viewers from changing the channel had a tremendous toll on one of the contestants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MAFS-Natasha-and-Mikey-via-Who-Magazine.jpg><p>Natasha Spencer, who got caught in the middle of the cheating scandal and received criticism for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">making a crude joke about Mikey</a>, revealed that she struggled to move on after the season. Fortunately, Spencer seems to have turned a corner by focusing on her mental health, changing her career, and learning from the experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The 10 Best Reality Shows Of 2020</a></span></p><h2 id=natasha-is-focusing-on-her-mental-health>Natasha is Focusing on Her Mental Health</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Filming a reality TV show for 1o hours daily</a> and getting thrown into the spotlight can take a toll on any person’s mental health. For Spencer, the MAFS experience was particularly traumatic because it triggered her anxiety.</p><p>“I had high functioning anxiety before [the show]. It was operational and manageable,” Spencer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained in an interview with Told You So</a>. “But after the show, it got so bad some days I was bedridden. I had a meltdown in April and was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital.”</p><p>In an earlier interview with Daily Mail Australia, Spencer revealed that this incident was spurred by the final MAFS episode and the heated criticism she received online.</p><p>“They had me psychologically evaluated and I was there for two or three hours … I had been having panic attacks and this was too much. They thought I was a danger to myself.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately, Spencer’s time in quarantine has given her the space she needs to recuperate.</p><p>“The last few months I have learned so much about myself. I am letting my life guide me. A huge part of anxiety is fear of the future, so by letting go, I’ve helped myself. I am learning how to cope better.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Married At First Sight' Exclusive Sneak Peek: Woody And Amani Argue About Pet Adoption</a></span></p><h2 id=a-career-switch>A Career Switch</h2><p>While focusing on her mental health and maintaining a social media presence, Spencer is also working on her career. Her job title on her MAFS Season 7 profile was listed as a financial analyst and she was described as “an outspoken and bold businesswoman who admits she speaks before she thinks — a habit which often lands her in hot water.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the interview with Told You So, however, Spencer expressed her desire to try something new.</p><p>“I now know that I want to redirect what I’m doing with my life,” she said. “I have re-enrolled in university and I am going to do an honors degree in Psychology.”</p><p>Spencer’s career switch aligns with her values, especially her desire to reduce stigmas surrounding mental health. In fact, Spencer uses her Instagram platform to discuss how she struggles and copes with anxiety. She hopes that her honesty can make a positive impact on her followers.</p><p>“It ties into everything I care about,” she explained. “I am aware of my platform and want to do some good.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality TV: 20 Behind The Scenes Photos We Can't Unsee</a></span></p><h2 id=after-a-year-natasha-reflected-on-her-tv-wedding-experience>After a Year, Natasha Reflected on Her “TV Wedding” Experience</h2><p>September 9th marked the one-year anniversary of Natasha Spencer’s TV wedding. While Spencer has been vocal about the experience in the past, she has become even more vocal in recent weeks.</p><p>One of Spencer’s Instagram posts reflecting on her Married at First Sight experience revealed just how difficult those five weeks of filming became, especially when they were coupled with intense public trolling. Fortunately, however, many fans could sense that Spencer finally seemed to be on the other side.</p><p>“With darkness comes light,” she wrote on September 9th. “I have let go of all the expectations of who I thought I should be and started spending time learning what I’m actually about and who I really am.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Spencer’s willingness to speak openly about her journey is indicative of a tremendous amount of growth and recovery. With a year under her belt since Australia's dramatic seventh season of MAFS, Spencer may finally be able to move on.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'90 Day Fiancé': How Do Couples Split Chores?
