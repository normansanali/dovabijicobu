He was born to Erin Horstmann and M Horstmann in Los Angeles, California, the Hollywood capital of the US. He is an American national who was born under the Aquarius zodiac sign and practices Christianity. Reports have it that he has two other siblings—a brother and a sister. Reed Horstmann can sing to some extent and he knows how to play the guitar.</p><p>His mother, Erin, is an artist while his father is an athlete which means that he developed a passion on both fronts. Before he chose to pursue a career in the film industry, Reed Horstmann participated in a lot of sporting activities early on as his dad coached him in football and baseball.</p><p>As a high school student, Reed participated in different sports. They include but are not limited to baseball, boxing, fencing, football, golf, skateboarding, snow skiing, swimming, and weight lifting.</p><p>He also watched a lot of movies growing up, mainly as a result of his mom’s influence. In one interview, the actor admitted that when he was a child, he didn’t understand that movies weren’t real life.</p><p>His fascination with the world of movies led him to want an entry into the movie industry as well. Reed’s childhood was also a very musical one, as he listened to a variety of genres and was encouraged to purchase some musical instruments.</p><h2><strong>His Acting Career Began in 2017&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Reed Horstmann’s acting career began when he was very young. His journey began when he appeared in a theater adaptation of&nbsp;The Hobbit, which encouraged him to act more.</p><p>His mother decided to enroll him in acting camps with friends and neighbors as an entertaining way to spend his summer, although he had not seriously considered becoming an actor at the time. However, in 2015, Horstmann made the serious decision to pursue acting even though he was already an accomplished fencer at the time.</p><p>Reed made his debut on the professional acting scene in 2017 when he was cast as Travis Blake in the short film, Cattle Call. The following year, he had the opportunity to appear in Our Souls at Night.</p><p>However, Reed’s life started to change in 2020 when he was cast as the lead in a major motion picture. Game On! A Comedy Crossover Event and the viewers’ favorite, The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia (2020) are among his best-recognized appearances. But the best of the pick would be his role as a superhero character named Chaos in the series, Villains of Valley View.</p><p>Although many fans think the 20-year-old actor made his debut in the critically acclaimed Villains of Valley View, that is rather very far from the truth. From all that’s been discussed above, it is clear that the 2022 comedy-drama series is not Reed’s first major role because he has been active since 2017.</p><p>However, we can say that Villains of Valley View is his best project yet. Reed Horstmann is presently being managed by The Block Agency, a Nashville-based talent agency.</p><h2><strong>Reed Received Formal Training In the Acting Field</strong></h2><p>After initially struggling to make up his mind as a child on which career path to follow, Reed Horstmann decided to settle for a career in acting and attended an acting workshop by signing up as an online student.</p><p>He attended masterclasses taught by John D’Aquino, a veteran Hollywood actor with acting credits in six well-known television shows including SWAT, Seinfeld, NCIS, CSI, Hannah Montana, and Cory in the House.</p><p>It was shortly after graduating from his acting classes that he landed a leading role in the TV series, The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia. His appearances on Disney’s Meet the Mayhems and Netflix’s Our Souls at Night were immediate follow-ups.</p><h3><strong>Reed Horstmann’s Movies and TV Shows</strong></h3><ul><li>Cattle Call (2017) as Travis Blake</li><li>Our Souls at Night (2017)</li><li>Game On! (2020)</li><li>The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia (2020)</li><li>The Villains of Valley View (2022)</li></ul><h2><strong>Who Is Reed Horstmann Dating?</strong></h2><p>In 2020, Reed Horstmann was linked severally to fellow The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia co-actor, Bella Podaras.</p><p>Bella, who played Brooke Bishop on the fantasy show, was his onscreen girlfriend, and naturally, the romance rumors began to fly. Bella Podaras also made an appearance in the television show, Game On! A Comedy Crossover Event, in which Reed was also featured.</p><p>The actor never came out to either confirm or deny the rumors of a relationship with the Houston-born actress, however, the truth has been revealed eventually. It turns out that Bella is dating actor Garrett Wareing and they have pictures to prove it.</p><p>Before Garrett, she was said to have dated Seth Lee. In fact, a quick search on her love life reveals that Reed Horstmann was never in the picture. At the moment, we still do not know who Reed is dating. While it’s possible that he is single, he might have hacked the art of staying private as an actor in Hollywood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZL%2BmscNmn6iqo6m6orrNZpmip12WtKZ5wKebZqiVp8CwusClZKWhlpp6sLKMrZ%2BeZZGisrO1wpqlZpmTqbyzew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./second-week-of-deer-camp-part-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Second Week of Deer Camp (Part 2)">&larr;
