When they choose to publicize things like having a baby or getting married, we admit that we can’t get enough. It doesn’t happen as often as it used to, but there have been plenty of celebrity couples who have tied the knot on television.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Of The Shortest Celebrity Marriages Ever</a></span></p><p>While yes, the majority of them are reality stars such as the Kardashians, plenty of them are also athletes and other celebrities. There are celebrity couples that have gotten married on tv and didn't last, while there are other couples who are still going strong today. Either way, these celebrity couples have given us plenty of entertainment.</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-amp-kris-humphries><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Kim Kardashian & Kris Humphries</span></h2><p>It really comes as no surprise that <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> had at least one of her weddings <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">televised</a>. Her wedding to professional basketball player Kris Humphries was filmed by E! for&nbsp;a&nbsp;Keeping Up With The Kardashians special of course.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Celeb Couples Who Admit To Going To Marriage Counseling</a></span></p><p>The wedding was filmed for a two-part special called&nbsp;Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event. We all know that their 72-day wedding was notoriously short. The wedding was so short that just three weeks after the two-part special was aired on E!, Kim filed for divorce and her fairytale wedding wasn't a fairytale wedding anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mario-lopez-amp-courtney-mazza><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Mario Lopez & Courtney Mazza</span></h2><p>It took <a href=#>Mario Lopez and Courtney Mazza</a> about five years of dating before they finally decided to tie the knot. The two decided that they wanted to have a destination wedding, as they got married in Mita, Mexico in front of approximately 150 people, and it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">filmed for television</a>. It was a star-studded event and included their daughter as the flower girl and Eva Longoria as a bridesmaid. The wedding was filmed especially to air on TLC and aired in December of 2012.</p><h2 id=trista-rehn-amp-ryan-sutter><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Trista Rehn & Ryan Sutter</span></h2><p>It only makes sense that <a href=#>Trista Rehn and Ryan Sutter</a> had their wedding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">televised</a>&nbsp;as the two are the original Bachelor Nation success story. Trista Rehn was the first runner-up on the very first season of&nbsp;The Bachelor and thus became the very first Bachelorette on the show's inaugural season.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Hid Their Marriages From The World</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the end, she wound up choosing Ryan Sutter, and the two have been together ever since. Their wedding aired in 2003 in a three-part series. The short series showed before the wedding as well as all the events leading up to the big day, ending it with the wedding.</p><h2 id=heidi-montag-amp-spencer-pratt><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Heidi Montag & Spencer Pratt</span></h2><p><a href=#>Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt</a> first got together on a reality show, so it only makes sense that they decided to have their wedding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">televised</a>. The two got married in Pasadena, California at the Westminster Presbyterian Church. The wedding was filmed by MTV and was eventually aired on an episode of&nbsp;The Hills. Before the big televised event, the two decided to elope for themselves. It was never clear whether they legally got married during their elopement, but either way, it was something for them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rob-mariano-amp-amber-brkich><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Rob Mariano & Amber Brkich</span></h2><p>"Boston Rob" Mariano and Amber Brkich were two very popular contestants on&nbsp;Survivor. The two played the game together, and they can thank the show for bringing them together. Since the beginning of their relationship as well as their engagement was very public on television, it only made sense for their wedding to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">televised</a> as well. CBS filmed their wedding that took place at the Atlantis, Paradise Island resort in the Bahamas. The two-hour special,&nbsp;Rob and Amber Get Married aired on CBS.</p><h2 id=khloe-kardashian-amp-lamar-odom><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Khloe Kardashian & Lamar Odom</span></h2><p>It really isn't surprising that there's a second Kardashian on this list, as their lives were literally documented for their show 24/7. <a href=#>Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom</a>&nbsp;had a very interesting relationship, one that included a wedding that was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">televised</a>. Khloe and Lamar got married in September of 2009 after they only dated for a month. The wedding was televised on&nbsp;Keeping Up With The Kardashians, of course, as she didn't get a separate special like Kim did. Regardless, the televised wedding led to them getting their own spinoff,&nbsp;Khloe & Lamar. She eventually filed for divorce in 2013 and it wasn't finalized until 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dave-navarro-amp-carmen-electra><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Dave Navarro & Carmen Electra</span></h2><p>In 2003 <a href=#>Carmen Electra</a> and Dave Navaro were yet another celebrity couple that tied the knot on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">television</a>. The two got married in Los Angeles at the St. Regis Hotel where cameras filmed their every move including the ceremony. MTV planned to air a series on the couple titled,&nbsp;'Til Death Do Us Part: Carmen & Dave.&nbsp;The wedding was absolutely star-studded and made for some really great TV. Unfortunately, their marriage didn't last too long, but we can always remember the two of them on their wedding day thanks to MTV.</p><h2>Kendra Wilkinson & Hank Baskett</h2><p>Playboy playmate <a href=#>Kendra Wilkinson</a> and professional football player Hank Basset are yet another&nbsp;celebrity couple who tied the knot on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">television</a>. The two got married in June of 2009 at the Playboy Mansion. Of course, being on a number of reality shows over the years, therefore their wedding and everything leading up to their wedding was featured on her reality shows.

As a result,&nbsp;<a href=#>Nick Lachey and his wife Vanessa Minnillo</a> had their big wedding day aired on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">television</a>. Their special was featured on TLC and included their wedding as well as everything leading up to the wedding such as Vanessa's dress shopping, as well as her wedding shower, and other pre-wedding festivities.</p><h2 id=carmelo-anthony-amp-lala-vasquez><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Carmelo Anthony & Lala Vasquez</span></h2><p>TV hose LaLa Vazquez and professional basketball player Carmelo Anthony had a very public relationship. so it only made sense that the two had their wedding filmed for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">television</a>. The two dated for seven years, and were engaged for five years, and even had a son together. The show,&nbsp;Lala's Full Court Wedding follows&nbsp;LaLa and Carmelo as they plan their wedding and make it to their big day when they tie the knot. Of course, there's a bit of drama, but that's what makes for some pretty good TV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Celebrity Couples Who Had Their Marriages Annulled (& Why)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmqitoKGytHnWoaZmn5%2Bpeq6t0augnpxdpLtuwNVo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./colby-rasmus.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Colby Rasmus">&larr;
