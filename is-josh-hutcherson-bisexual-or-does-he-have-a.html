Read the article to learn everything you want to know.</strong></p><p>Joshua Ryan Hutcherson is an American actor and producer who has played in numerous movies, including Journey to the center of the Earth, Little Manhattan, Zathura: A Space Adventure, and more.</p><p>Furthermore, he got the role of Peeta Mellark from the box office record-setting film series The Hunger Games when he was only 18 years. He won three MTV Movie Awards and a People’s Choice Award for his excellent acting.</p><p>In addition, he has also produced many movies throughout his career. He has worked as an executive producer for Detention, The Forger, and Escobar while he played the lead role in each film.</p><p>The actor also has been raising his voice and getting involved in the gay-straight alliance campaign “Straight But Not Narrow.”</p><h2>Is Josh Hutcherson Bisexual Or Does He Have A Girlfriend?</h2><p>The Hunger Games actor Josh is quite like his costar Jennifer Lawrence, who is unafraid to express his opinion.</p><p>Josh said in an insightful interview for the November issue of the gay and lesbian lifestyle publication, “I would probably list myself as mostly straight. Maybe I could say I’m 100% straight right now, but who knows? In a F**king year, I could meet a guy and be like, Whoa, I’m attracted to this person.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/1580242659519913984_1.jpg><p>The actor is also a well-known founder of the anti-homophobic youth organization Straight But Not Narrow, who is currently dating actress Claudia Traisac, but that doesn’t imply he is any less accepting of LGBT concerns.</p><p>Furthermore, he said, ” I’ve met guys all the time that I’m like, ‘Damn, that’s a good-looking guy,’ you know? I’ve never been, like,’ Oh, I want to kiss that guy, I love women, but defining yourself as 100 percent anything is kind of near-sighted and close-minded.”</p><p>Finally, with all the statements given by the actor himself, it can be concluded by saying he is also not sure whether he is bisexual or not.</p><p>But, the actor is even more appreciated when he jokes that a threesome between Peeta, Katniss, and Gale would make the Hunger Games trilogy the best fantasy yet.</p><p>Read more: <a href=# rel=bookmark>What Happened To Kirra Hart Queensland?

However, despite his parents’ reservations about the industry, his enthusiasm for performing grew as a young child.</p><p>The actor claimed he had ‘loved the entertainment industry’ since he was four. His father claimed that because of his son’s attention-grabbing nature, he was forced to perform for people from a very young age.</p><p>He ‘bugged us so much, according to his mother, into becoming actors, but she thought it was just a phase he was going through that he would outgrow.</p><h2>Josh Hutcherson net Worth</h2><p>Josh is an American actor that works in both film and television.
