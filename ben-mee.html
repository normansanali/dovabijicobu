Mee made his first Premier League start of the season in the opening match as a left-back, as Burnley lost 3–1 to Chelsea. Mee went on to score the late equaliser for Burnley in the reverse fixture at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea to keep the final score 1–1, his goal being the second goal of the season Chelsea conceded from a corner kick.</p><p>In the 2013–14 season, Mee sustained a knee injury in the pre-season friendly and made a return, though he missed the first four matches, due to being on the bench. From late-December to January, Mee had been absent twice in weeks. Despite the absent, Mee played a vital role as a left-back position, where he helped the club get promoted to Premier League and made thirty-eight appearances.</p><p>On 10 January 2012, Burnley boss <a href=#>Eddie Howe</a> expressed interest in signing Mee on a permanent basis with Manchester City sanctioning a sale just days after signing former Manchester City teammate <a href=#>Kieran Trippier</a> who was also on loan at the club. Mee joined on a permanent three and a half-year deal on 17 January for an undisclosed fee. His move to Burnley has comes as no surprise to find that the club have moved to bring him on board full-time. During a match against Reading in a 1–0 loss on 27 February 2012, Mee made an impressive tremendous clearance by using his head to block a <a href=#>Noel Hunt</a> shot to prevent Reading scoring for a second time. However, his season ended after suffering a slight back fracture which he sustained during a 5–1 win over Portsmouth. In combination of his loan spell and permanent spell at Burnley, Mee finished his season, making thirty-one appearances.</p><p>In the 2012–13 season, Mee started his season when he appeared sporadic at the start until he scored his first goal for the club, in a 2–2 draw against Millwall on 28 September 2012.

Mee made his return from injury, on 11 March 2013, as Burnley and Hull City both drew 1–1.

After signing for the club, Mee would join his Manchester City's teammate <a href=#>Greg Cunningham</a> at Leicester City. After two weeks yet playing them, Mee finally made his debut for Leicester City in a 4–2 win over Millwall. On 12 March 2011, Mee provided his first professional assist for Miguel Vítor to score his first goal in the match against Scunthorpe United which he scored twice later in the match which Leicester City won 3–0.

On 29 November 2011, Mee got his first clean sheet for Burnley without letting an opponent score, capping a perfect birthday for Burnley manager <a href=#>Eddie Howe</a> in a 4–0 win over Ipswich Town.</p><p>Mee was given his first real test of first-team experience when he was taken on City's US tour in the summer of 2010, with club manager Roberto Mancini expressing that he wanted to blood his youth players and have a chance to see what they could do at a higher level than reserve fixtures. Mee made up two appearances, against Portland Timbers and New York Red Bulls.</p><p>After being given number 41 shirt, Mee followed up his tour appearances with a starting line-up appearance in the League Cup against West Bromwich Albion on 22 September 2010 in a 2–1 away loss. Alongside Mee making his debut, <a href=#>Javan Vidal</a> and <a href=#>John Guidetti</a> were given their first competitive appearances for the club in a match where three of the four players in the defensive line were young Elite Development Squad players and a full six of the starting line-up were aged 21 or younger and had come through the club's academy system.</p><p>After the end of 2010–11 season, Mee returned to Manchester City after 6 months at Leicester City. Following the sacking of Sven Göran Eriksson, Mee commented that he was sad to hear of the news.</p><p>Mee was born in Sale, Greater Manchester.
