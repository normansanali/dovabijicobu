The couple, who had a 14-year age gap, announced their split in 2012, citing that it was a "mutual decision."</p><p id=eJDj9NCIBMx data-wc=34>At the time, Harry wrote in a Twitter post: "Please know that I didn't 'dump' Caroline.

At the beginning it was all very playful. He joked about being attracted to older women. It began to go wrong when Harry was pictured coming out of my house one morning."</p><p id=eJd9znGUtgU data-wc=28>She continued: "And once that was out, it was open season. After that anyone could say anything. In the street people started shouting at me 'pedophile' and 'pervert.'"</p><p id=e02vajkfsLc data-wc=34>Flack died by suicide in 2020.

During their time together, Camille was spotted at several of Harry's concerts across the US and Europe.</p><p id=epAGG89AOtmP data-wc=43>While they never officially confirmed their romance, reported that they'd broken up in July 2018. During an interview with Rolling Stone in 2019, Harry's collaborator Tom Hull spoke about one of Harry's break-ups, seemingly referring to the singer's romance with Camille.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cc8656d09a65-camille-rowe-black-dress.jpg><p id=e8_Rz5Fy0rw0 data-wc=76>"He went through this breakup that had a big impact on him," he said.
