Teaming alongside Cody Rhodes, Seth Rollins, Sami Zayn, and Jey Uso, he played a pivotal role in defeating The Judgment Day and Drew McIntyre. It had been a return a year and a half in the making. Fans were elated when they got to see “The Viper” step back into the squared circle. Orton is a highly accomplished competitor and has put on classic matches. In addition, he has some of the most recognizable tattoos in WWE history. Let’s take a closer look at Orton’s famous pieces.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's hard to throw a rock in a wrestling locker room and not hit someone <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">boasting a lot of tattoos</a>. Just like pro athletes, wrestlers enjoy getting themselves inked up and showing it off. Samoan wrestlers, in particular, have a fondness for ink with intricate tribal patterns. Other wrestlers can be highlighted, like Jeff Hardy and Rey Mysterio's amazingly tattooed bodies.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/collage-maker-12-mar-2023-02-29-pm-3142.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Meanings Behind WWE Legend Dave Bautista's Tattoos</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Batista's range of tattoos now covers a significant part of his body, having acquired multiple new tattoos during his wrestling career.</span><p>Another major tattooed wrestler is <a href=#><strong>Randy Orton</strong></a>. Since his WWE debut in 2002, Orton has shown a fondness for some ink with patterns on his back and arms. It's grown over the years with his arms almost totally covered and a few other tattoos elsewhere. While some have personal meaning, a few are interesting in the stories behind them, including a surprising controversy. These are ten fascinating background stories involving Randy Orton's tattoos which add to his appeal as a WWE superstar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=randy-orton-39-s-arm-tattoos-took-hours><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Randy Orton's Arm Tattoos Took Hours</span></h2><h3 id=orton-39-s-most-iconic-tattoos-are-his-skulls>Orton's Most Iconic Tattoos Are His Skulls</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><ul><li><strong>Randy Orton's skull tattoos took 50 hours to complete.</strong></li><li><strong>He touches them up each year.</strong></li><li><strong>Each touch up takes six hours.</strong></li></ul><p>Tattoo work can be a complex process, especially for the type Orton has. The biggest was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">covering his arms </a>in a variety of tribal patterns, skulls, verses, and roses. While his first tattoos were just for show, Orton wanted to showcase his growing maturity and connection to family.</p><p>He's tight-lipped on the meaning of some of them, such as the skulls but has detailed it took nearly 50 hours to complete it all. That's not counting at least six hours of touch-up work per year, as Orton's ink is among the most complex in wrestling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=randy-orton-and-his-wife-have-matching-tattoos><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Randy Orton And His Wife Have Matching Tattoos</span></h2><h3 id=they-have-their-names-tattooed-on-each-other>They Have Their Names Tattooed On Each Other</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/orton-wife.jpg><ul><li><strong>Randy Orton and Kim Kessler married each other in 2015.</strong></li><li><strong>They have one daughter together.</strong></li><li><strong>Orton has a tattoo dedicated to her on his ribs.</strong></li></ul><p>Orton <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">and his wife Kim</a> are well known for their fun photos together online.

He had a huge ego and threw his weight around but has been mellowing since.</p><p>To try and remind himself of changing his ways, Orton had tattooed on his arm a verse from Peter 5:8 which reads, "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour." This verse is something Orton takes to heart, adjusting his attitude in his career.</p><h2 id=randy-orton-tried-to-copy-goldberg-39-s-tribal-tattoo><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Randy Orton Tried To Copy Goldberg's Tribal Tattoo</span></h2><h3 id=an-artist-told-him-not-to-do-it>An Artist Told Him Not To Do It</h3><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTusb8u91cM</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Goldberg's tribal tattoo has been one of his most recognizable features.</strong></li><li><strong>Orton wanted to copy Goldberg's tattoo, but an artist advised him against it.</strong></li><li><strong>Orton has a variety of different tribal tattoos on his body.</strong></li></ul><p>Like many wrestlers, Orton had his idols when he was growing up and getting ready to enter the business. In his case, he was a huge fan of Bill Goldberg in 1998 to the point of going to an artist and asking him to replicate Goldberg's famous tribal art arm tattoo.</p><p>This <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">was against his mother's wishes</a>, and the artist refused, saying that wearing someone else's art wasn't a good idea. Orton is now happy he didn't get it as he prefers his more original tattoos over mimicking Goldberg's. He spoke about this on Ryan Satin's Out Of Character podcast:</p><p>"So Goldberg’s my guy and I’m an idiot [laughter]. So you know, the tattoo artist said ‘How about, let’s come up with something that’s just for you,’ So okay, that’s a good idea. And so you know, some version, one of this was born. But anyway, I forgot what we were talking about.

He <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">told WWE.com</a> "I'd like to see what I look like without them sometimes."</p><p>He's also admitted the touch-ups every year take hours as the wear and tear of wrestling affects them. It's also a factor with Orton's numerous injuries over the years, and while the tattoos look imposing in the ring, he himself seems to wish he hadn't gone as far with them as he did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-first-major-tattoo-caused-some-pain><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>His First Major Tattoo Caused Some Pain</span></h2><h3 id=he-got-his-backpiece-while-in-ovw>He Got His Backpiece While In OVW</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/big-show-vs-randy-orton-wwe-survivor-series.jpg><ul><li><strong>Randy Orton's back tattoo has been one of the most iconic of his tattoos.</strong></li><li><strong>He got it while in OVW.</strong></li><li><strong>OVW was WWE's former developmental territory prior to FCW and NXT.</strong></li></ul><p>One of Orton's first major pieces of ink was the tribal pattern on his upper back. It's a fun pattern that looks like it belongs on a powerful Samoan worker. Many have asked for its meaning, but it turns out there really isn't one. Orton just got it for fun while he was <a href=#>starting his career in OVW</a>.</p><p>However, Orton didn't realize that having a back tattoo and then wrestling right after it was a bad idea. He spent weeks with a nasty scab that simply wouldn't heal, so rather than looking cool, the tattoo caused Orton some early pain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>WWE Debut</strong></p></td><td><p>4/25/2002</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Notable Accomplishments</strong></p></td><td><p>WWE Champion, World Heavyweight Champion, WWE Intercontinental Champion, WWE United States Champion, World Tag Team Champion, Men's Money In The Bank Winner (2013), Royal Rumble Winner (2009, 2017), OVW Hardcore Champion</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Notable Rivals</strong></p></td><td><p>John Cena, Edge, Triple H, Batista, The Undertaker, Shawn Michaels, Kofi Kingston, Daniel Bryan</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=the-tribal-art-covers-up-an-old-shame><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Tribal Art Covers Up An Old Shame</span></h2><h3 id=it-covers-up-a-marine-tattoo>It Covers Up A Marine Tattoo</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/randy-orton-1-3.jpg><ul><li><strong>Orton had joined the Marines in 1998 after high school.</strong></li><li><strong>He was discharged after going AWOL and disobeying an officer.</strong></li><li><strong>He used to have a Marine tattoo on his left arm.</strong></li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He doesn't enjoy talking about it much, but <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Orton's military career ended poorly.</a> He had enlisted in the Marines and even got a USMC tattoo on his arm.

It was a problem when Randy Orton's tattoo artist sued them in 2018. The issue was when Orton's likeness was used in WWE 2K18 and, as usual, made to look as close to Orton as possible. That meant replicating his tattoos much better than in previous games.</p><p>That led to Catherine Alexander <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">suing WWE and Take-Two Games,</a> claiming that the artwork was her own and being used without her permission or payment.
