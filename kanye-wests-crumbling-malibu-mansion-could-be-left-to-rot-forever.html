just a few doors down from an Adidas store - has had the windows and doors covered with the entire space painted dark gray in Ye's signature style.</p><p>Workers were seen hammering and building structures at the back of the property earlier this month, while other team members were busy sanding the floors inside.</p><h2>ONGOING LAWSUITS</h2><p>It appears Kanye is focusing only on the new space in an attempt to relaunch his <a href=#>fashion</a> and music career, as his derelict properties have been put on the back burner.</p><p>They aren't the only issues he's facing, as the star has been hit with numerous lawsuits in the last few years from disgruntled former employees and fellow artists claiming he's stolen their riffs.</p><p>A court search of previous Yeezy lawsuits, many also involving Adidas, reveals it's been in litigation 952 times in the US, while Kanye has personally been sued 94 times.</p><p>Among his biggest problems is a suit brought by <a href=#>The Gap</a> which is suing him for $2million in the wake of their failed partnership, according to documents obtained by TMZ.</p><p>The Gap is being sued by Art City Center, a company that claims it owns a building in Downtown Los Angeles that was leased by them as a storefront of the Yeezy clothing line.</p><p>Kanye is also being sued by former teachers at his controversial LA Christian school, <a href=#>Donda Academy</a>, alleging labor violations and restrictive and unusual school rules.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Court documents alleged the children were only allowed to eat sushi, the school had no janitorial or medical services, and Kanye wouldn't allow the teachers or students to wear any jewelry.</p><p>The teachers also allege the school did not meet Department of Education requirements or follow state regulations, with the case still going through the courts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/2021-reported-57-3-million-820009691.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/kanye-west-speaks-stage-kanye-794673520.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/shot-us-sun-kanye-wests-818595792-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwYmaFcn%2BWaKKapqmaerix0q2qZpuiqrqjuMinnmalkaG2o8GMppinq5mku26vzq6jnWWSmnqtscWtZK2nXae8tXnFqKmerpWnfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ngolo-kante-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="NGolo Kant Net Worth: How Much is NGolo Kant Worth?">&larr;
