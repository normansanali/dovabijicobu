She has not been through any controversy recently.</p><h2><span id=Controversy>Controversy</span></h2><p>The controversy resurfaced in October 2017. Samantha spoke out against the company on the eve of ESPN2’s debut of the late-night show Barstool Van Talk. The show featured Pardon My Take podcast hosts Dan “Big Cat” Katz and PFT Commenter.&nbsp;The Sunday Morning Countdown host sarcastically greeted Katz by tweeting out screenshots of crude comments she thought he made about her in a 2014 blog post on Barstool Sports.</p><p>Katz responded to the tweet, claiming he did not write the post nor the editor’s note that referred to her as a “bible-thumping freak.” He also said he defended her in a video segment. He tweeted:</p><p>“Hey Sam, thanks for the welcome. I just want to clear one thing up, I didn’t write this blog post (you make it seem like I did) and the rundown you reference I actually defended you.”</p><p>She took to Twitter again on Tuesday to place the blame on Barstool founder and president Dave Portnoy. She tweeted:</p><p>“I was wrong in thinking @BarstoolBigCat wrote that article & called me a slut repeatedly. He just continuously laughed along,” she wrote. “It was the PRESIDENT of @barstoolsports who said these things. Happy to clarify.”</p><p>There is a recording from 2014, which Twitter user @sensitivemann shared with Ponder Monday night. It features a conversation between Portnoy and Katz. Portnoy suggested that Ponder “sex it up and be slutty,” while Katz added, “There’s no one worse right now than Ponder. She is the absolute worst. I hate-follow her on Twitter. I can’t even stand her. Every time she tweets I want to puke all over my computer.”</p><p>On Wednesday morning, Ponder sent out a series of tweets that addressed the controversy again, stating in part that:</p><p>“I am disappointed that we are promoting a company name that still maintains support for horrific personal attacks against multiple women within ESPN.”</p><p>Following this, ESPN canceled Barstool Van Talk after one episode. This came after she brought the explicit Dave Portnoy blog post and rant targeting her to the public eye. John Skipper, the then-president of ESPN, made the executive decision to pull the plug on the content partnership. Following this, Portnoy called Samantha a “cancer just spreading and infecting the network.”</p><p>Furthermore, the Barstool Sports-Sam Ponder Feud cranked up to a whole new level in September 2018. On September 11, 2018, she wrote in her tweet that she did not want Barstool Van Talk to be canceled and that she had been willing to appear on the show to discuss her issues. To this,&nbsp;Portnoy responded with a post titled In The Face Of Plunging Ratings And Unheard of Unpopularity Sam Ponder Has Resorted To Flat Out Lying About Barstool Sports To Save Her Job At ESPN.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements>Body Measurements</span></h2><p>Samantha has an amazing personality and a stunning body.
