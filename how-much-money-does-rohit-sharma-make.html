Known for his explosive batting skills and exceptional leadership qualities, Sharma has achieved numerous milestones throughout his career. As a result, he has not only earned a massive fan following but has also become one of the highest-paid cricketers in the world. In this article, we will explore the various sources of income for Rohit Sharma and estimate how much money he makes.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>IPL Contract</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>One of the primary sources of income for Rohit Sharma is his contract with the Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Sharma has been associated with the Mumbai Indians since the inception of the league in 2008. Initially, his contract was worth a modest amount, but as he established himself as a key player and captain of the team, his earnings soared. In 2018, he was appointed as the captain of the Mumbai Indians, which further boosted his financial worth. As of 2021, Sharma's IPL contract with the Mumbai Indians is estimated to be around INR 15 crore (approximately $2 million) per season.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Central Contract with BCCI</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Apart from the IPL, Rohit Sharma also earns a significant amount of money through his central contract with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The BCCI is the governing body for cricket in India and offers central contracts to players based on their performance and experience. These contracts are categorized into different grades, with Grade A+ being the highest. As of 2021, Sharma is in Grade A+ and earns an annual retainer fee of INR 7 crore (approximately $1 million). In addition to the retainer fee, he also receives match fees for every international match he plays.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Brand Endorsements</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Rohit Sharma's success and popularity have made him a sought-after brand ambassador for various companies. He has endorsed several big brands, including Adidas, Hublot, Maggi, and CEAT, among others. These brand endorsements provide him with a substantial additional income. While the exact amount he earns from endorsements is not publicly disclosed, it is believed to be in the range of several crores (tens of millions) of rupees per year. Sharma's marketability, combined with his on-field success, has made him a lucrative choice for brands looking to tap into the cricket-loving Indian market.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Prize Money and Bonuses</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>As a professional cricketer, Rohit Sharma has earned a significant amount of prize money and bonuses throughout his career. This includes winnings from tournaments such as the IPL, international series, and ICC events like the World Cup and Champions Trophy. The exact amount of prize money Sharma has earned is not readily available, but considering his numerous achievements, it is safe to assume that he has accumulated a substantial sum in prize money over the years. Additionally, he also receives bonuses from the BCCI for achieving personal and team milestones.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Investments and Business Ventures</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Like many other cricketers, Rohit Sharma has also ventured into business and investments. He has invested in various ventures, including sports academies and real estate. Sharma also owns a sports equipment company called "Cricketer's Prince," which manufactures cricket gear and apparel. These business ventures not only provide him with additional income but also serve as a long-term investment for his future.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Rohit Sharma's financial success is a testament to his exceptional skills and popularity as a cricketer. Through his IPL contract, central contract with the BCCI, brand endorsements, prize money, and business ventures, Sharma has amassed a considerable fortune. While the exact figure of his net worth is not publicly disclosed, it is estimated to be in the range of several million dollars. As he continues to excel on the cricket field and explore new opportunities off it, Rohit Sharma's earnings are likely to grow even further, solidifying his position as one of the highest-earning cricketers in the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6hprBlnaqwqXnMqKWesV2ZvKa%2FjKumoaGkYsCprdGmmGalkaCy</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./louis-philippe-rivard-wikipedia-everything-to-know-about-the-writer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Louis-Philippe Rivard Wikipedia: Everything To Know About The Writer">&larr;
