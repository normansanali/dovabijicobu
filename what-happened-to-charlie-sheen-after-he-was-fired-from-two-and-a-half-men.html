The veteran actor was then known for his popular role on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">beloved sitcom</a>Two And A Half Men, but antics in the actor's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">personal life</a> were quickly eclipsing any activity or accolades received in his professional life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sheen was struggling with substance abuse behind-the-scenes, and it was becoming harder for Sheen to hide his troubles from the public. After several often-<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">incoherent public outbursts</a>, he needed more than 'tiger blood' to salvage his public reputation. He was eventually let go from his Two And A Half Men contract, after repeatedly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">causing production to go haywire</a>.</p><p>Life for anyone involved with Two And A Half Men&nbsp;was rough for awhile following Sheen's departure. Here's what happened after Sheen was let go!</p><h2 id=money-began-looking-green-for-sheen><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Money Began Looking 'Green' For Sheen</span></h2><p>Charlie Sheen found a seemingly permanent place in the spotlight after he was terminated from his Two And A Half Men contract; his behind-the-scenes activities created a spectacle in the entertainment world for a long time!</p><p>Even though Charlie often appeared chipper in public, he was dealing with much deeper matters in his personal life. He had taken a big financial hit, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">based on a report from</a>&nbsp;Vanity Fair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charlie-lived-life-as-a-keyboard-warrior><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Charlie Lived Life As A Keyboard Warrior</span></h2><p>The gossip about Charlie's final "curtain call" on Two And A Half Men didn't get the so-called 'Tiger Blood' master down! In fact, he was inspired to keep creating content and generating buzz about his flailing personal life.</p><p>Charlie thought of a creative way to continue working the Internet to his advantage, by creating a Web show three months after his infamous firing.</p><h2 id=courtroom-drama-became-a-pasttime><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>&nbsp;Courtroom Drama Became A Pasttime</span></h2><p>Charlie may have been in the 'hot seat' with many people professionally, and the dramatic nature of his life at the time brought him into the 'big house!'</p><p>Charlie's distaste for higher-ups in charge, behind-the-scenes, was so strong...to the point where it crossed the threshold into the courtroom. He made the decision to sue Two And A Half Men's production company and producer.</p><h2 id=he-got-back-to-business><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>He Got Back To Business</span></h2><p>The entertainment world had a lot to say about Charlie's antics, but the actor made the decision to tune out the noise when he signed on to do a televised version of Anger Management. According to the Washington Post, the show had longevity, with 100 episodes produced!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite his problems, he remained a Hollywood fixture.</p><h2 id=charlie-had-no-time-to-repair-relationships><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Charlie Had No Time To Repair Relationships</span></h2><p>In the wake of Charlie's public downfall, it's fair to say that a once-key player in his life won't be waving to him if they run into each other on the street!</p><p>It's no secret that Jon Cryer and Charlie do not get along. The former co-stars were actually extremely close at first, but the friendship is no more.</p><h2 id=media-went-mad><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Media Went Mad</span></h2><p>While Charlie may have seemed like a disgraced actor to some, following his exit from Two And A Half Men, the media didn't hesitate to capitalize on his fame and popularity!</p><p>According to the Hollywood Reporter, Sheen was offered a contract for a stage adaptation of his story, which would be developed. This was much to the chagrin of many, including Jon Cryer, as Cryer later revealed in his memoir.</p><h2 id=fans-came-for-cryer><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Fans Came For Cryer</span></h2><p>The hypothetical tornado caused by Charlie's public meltdown quickly engrossed many people involved in Sheen's camp, including some extremely notable names!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 'keyboard warriors' came in hot with their unsolicited 'hot takes' against Jon Cryer. According to the actor, people were quick to point fingers toward him for Sheen's downfall, when in reality, Charlie often targeted his former co-star in the press.</p><h2 id=he-had-choice-words-for-higher-ups><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He&nbsp;Had Choice Words For Higher Ups</span></h2><p>Hardly anyone in Charlie's orbit escaped his wrath in the aftermath of his termination.</p><p>A name extremely important in Charlie's history is Chuck Lorre, who was responsible for co-creating Two And A Half Men, as well as many other notable projects.</p><p>Dodging Charlie's public insults became a so-called 'notable project' in Lorre's life, post-Two And A Half Men; Charlie frequently targeted him online.</p><h2 id=charlie-s-family-life-takes-the-spotlight><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Charlie's Family Life Takes The Spotlight</span></h2><p>Those closest to Charlie were forced to weather the storm. Public perception was shifting and this could've had extremely detrimental effects for those personally involved with him... especially his wives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His wife, Brooke Mueller, had enough of her ex-husband's behavior; she petitioned for a restraining order against Charlie. After she filed in 2013, the New York Times reported that her motion was rejected.</p><h2 id=his-actions-take-a-dangerous-toll><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>His Actions Take A Dangerous Toll</span></h2><p>Sometimes our actions can have dangerous consequences in the long run. The decisions made in Charlie's private life may have led him to be diagnosed with HIV.</p><p>In 2015, Charlie made the big decision to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">speak publicly</a> about his diagnosis on the Today Show&nbsp;- he did a personal interview. Charlie's candid discussion reminded the public of the human being who was behind the spectacle.</p><h2 id=charlie-continued-to-bite-the-hand-that-fed-him><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Charlie Continued To Bite The Hand That Fed Him</span></h2><p>Two and A Half Men experienced its share of wear and tear during the many years it was on the air. The sitcom ran for 12 seasons, which is an unusual feat, even by today's standards!</p><p>While friends and fans of the show may celebrate the show's long-running milestone, there was a notable name with something to say. Charlie publicly spoke out - and made fun of its shelf life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">23 Mistakes On Two And A Half Men Most Fans Didn’t Notice</a></span></p><h2 id=charlie-tried-extending-an-olive-branch-to-this-celeb><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Charlie Tried Extending An Olive Branch To This Celeb</span></h2><p>It doesn't take a devoted fan of the series to notice there were many more than Two And A Half Men involved in the show!</p><p>Ashton Kutcher came into the spotlight in the aftermath of Charlie Sheen's exit from the show - he was cast as Sheen's replacement.</p><p>Of course, there was some strife between Kutcher and Sheen, which Sheen attempted to repair.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Ashton Kutcher Stepped Away From Acting</a></span></p><h2 id=jon-cryer-broke-it-off><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jon Cryer Broke It Off</span></h2><p>We know it's extremely unlikely that Charlie's relationship with Jon Cryer will get better, due to their extremely public feud, but Cryer actually has a caveat; Charlie would have to change his ways.</p><p>According to the Huffington Post, Jon isn't interested in having Charlie play a part in his life unless he changes his lifestyle and becomes sober, which Sheen later did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Juicy Details About Charlie And Alan's Relationship BTS Of Two And A Half Men</a></span></p><h2 id=charlie-untied-the-knot><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Charlie Untied The Knot</span></h2><p>Charlie's personal life was multi-faceted. Not only did he have lots of water under the bridge from his Two And A Half Men exit, but he was also a veteran at walking down the aisle. He had three failed marriages!</p><p>Wedding bells were set to ring for Charlie and his new woman, but according to E!,&nbsp;that wedding was destined for cancellation.</p><h2 id=his-relationship-with-roseanne-got-rocky><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>His Relationship With Roseanne Got Rocky</span></h2><p>Roseanne knows a thing or two about living life in the midst of scandal. The actress experienced a humongous career setback after her revival of the sitcom that made her famous was canceled, due to her questionable Twitter habits.</p><p>Charlie, however, seemed satisfied when he heard of the series' cancellation...and Roseanne's exit. He used the news as an opportunity to hype a Two And A Half Men revival.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Where Charlie Sheen Is Now</a></span></p><p>Sources:&nbsp;Entertainment Weekly,&nbsp;Vanity Fair,&nbsp;Washington Post</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq%2FHmqmloZViwKmxxKdkmp6kmr9utMRmrpqrXZu2s7HDZp2rp51iwbi7jJqlnWWRYrWiuMVmpJ6mXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./would-have-been-her-dream-jemima-gazley-remembered-on-the-italian-alps.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Would have been her dream': Jemima Gazley remembered on the Italian Alps">&larr;
