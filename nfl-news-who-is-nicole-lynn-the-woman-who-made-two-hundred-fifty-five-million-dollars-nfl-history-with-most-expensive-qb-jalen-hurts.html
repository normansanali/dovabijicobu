In an industry that is predominantly male-dominated, Lynn has been a trailblazer in every sense of the word. Recently, the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>NFL</a> star quarterback Jalen Hurts signed a record-breaking five-year contract extension worth up to $255 million. All due to his Superagent Nicole Lynn. But who is she? Let’s explore!</p><p>Nicole made history twice by representing back-to-back top 10 NFL draft picks. The recent deal includes a $23,294,000 signing bonus and a staggering $179,300,000 in fully guaranteed money, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>making Hurts the highest-paid player in NFL history.</a> The contract also includes a no-trade clause. She also&nbsp;has several entertainment industry clients. STARZ is developing a TV show based on her life, with Nicole serving as an executive producer alongside Tash Gray.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>The remarkable story of Agent Nicole Lynn</strong></h2><p>Nicole Lynn, the first Black woman to represent an NFL draft pick, is an American sports agent. Kelli Masters, an American sports agent, and lawyer was the <strong>first woman</strong> to do so.</p><p>In 2015, she graduated with honors from Oklahoma’s law school, and at just 26 years of age, she signed her first client, Seth Roberts. It all began with Seth Roberts, who believed in her. She grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and attended Booker T. Washington High School.</p><p>She is the first female agent to work at player rep sports management and is an attorney, author, and <strong>president of football operations at Clutch Sports</strong>. She wrote a book named ‘Agent You: Show Up, Do the Work, and Succeed on Your Own Terms’.</p><p>Nicole Lynn, an attorney and NFL sports agent based in Houston, Texas, had her fair share of struggles. In second grade, Lynn had a special librarian, Miss Terry, who not only shaped her life but saved it. Lynn is grateful for Miss Terry’s kindness, including providing food, clothes, and her first birthday gift.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>How Nicole Lynn helped Jalen Hurts rise to NFL Stardom?</strong></h2><p>In 2021, Lynn made a move to Clutch Sports, where she represents some of the NFL’s biggest stars, including Quinnen Williams, Myles Garrett, and of course, Jalen Hurts. Lynn described signing Hurts as an absolute Hail Mary. She slid into his DMs after his last game at Oklahoma with a message that read, “Hey, have you picked an agent? If not, I’d love to link up.” And it worked.</p><p>After the establishment of the link, <strong>Hurts’ agent Nicole help him to get an average annual salary of $51,000,000, and in 2023</strong>, he will earn a base salary of $4,204,000 and a workout bonus of $100,000.

This was her the first black woman agent to represent a starting quarterback in a Super Bowl.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>How Nicole’s wealth mindset helped her win big?</strong></h2><p>Nicole shared her winning wealth mindset, advising people to save their money, pay off their debts, and not wait too long to take risks.</p><p>Jalen Hurts speaks on his Agent Nicole, “Her being an African-American female, so many different things you gotta overcome, doing that in any field, let alone being an agent in football and in sports. It’s tough, but it’s nothing that she can’t handle.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>After getting NFL star Jalen Hurts a $255 million contract making him the highest-paid NFL player in history, his agent Nicole Lynn is getting a TV series about her life produced by 50 Cent. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gi498UT4wI</a></p><p>— Black Millionaires ® (@Blackmillions_) <a href=#>April 23, 2023</a></p><p>She believes that everyone has to take a Hail Mary at some point in their personal or professional lives.
