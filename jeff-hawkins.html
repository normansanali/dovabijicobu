He is the co-founder of Palm Computing, Handspring, and Numenta. He is also the author of the book On Intelligence, which proposes a theory of how the human neocortex works. Hawkins was born in Huntington, New York, and grew up in Santa Clara, California. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied electrical engineering and computer science. After graduating in 1979, he worked at Intel and then at GRiD Systems, where he designed the GRiDPad, one of the first tablet computers. In 1992, Hawkins co-founded Palm Computing, which developed the PalmPilot, one of the first successful personal digital assistants. In 1998, he co-founded Handspring, which developed the Treo smartphone. In 2005, he founded Numenta, a company that develops machine learning algorithms based on his theory of how the neocortex works. Hawkins has received numerous awards for his work, including the Marconi Prize, the IEEE John von Neumann Medal, and the Benjamin Franklin Medal. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p><table class="table table-col-2"><tbody readability=1.7701149425287><tr><td>Popular As</td><td>Jeffrey Hawk</td></tr><tr><td>Occupation</td><td>Businessperson</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td><a href=#>66 years old</a></td></tr><tr><td>Zodiac Sign</td><td>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td>Born</td><td>1 June, <a href=#>1957</a></td></tr><tr><td>Birthday</td><td>1 June</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Birthplace</td><td>Huntington, New York, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td><a href=#>U.S.</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>We recommend you to check the complete list of Famous People born on 1 June.

Hawkins explains, "When the brain builds a model of the world, everything has a location relative to everything else".</p><p>In March 2005, Hawkins, together with Dubinsky (Palm's original CEO) and <a href=#>Dileep George</a>, founded Numenta, Inc.</p><p>In 2002, after two decades of finding little interest from neuroscience institutions, Hawkins founded the Redwood Neuroscience Institute in Menlo Park, California. As a result of the formation of Hawkins' new company, Numenta, the Institute was moved to the University of California, Berkeley on July 1, 2005, renamed the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, and is now administered through the <a href=#>Helen Wills</a> Neuroscience Institute.</p><p>In 2004, Hawkins published On Intelligence (with The New York Times science writer Sandra Blakeslee), laying out his "memory-prediction framework" of how the brain works. The memory-prediction framework encompases a number of methods that the brain uses to classify input and recognize patterns. Hawkins' theory suggests an "unsupervised learning system" where accurate modelling is the only goal.</p><p>In 2003, Hawkins was elected as a member of the National Academy of Engineering "for the creation of the hand-held computing paradigm and the creation of the first commercially successful example of a hand-held computing device." He also serves on the Advisory Board of the Secular Coalition for America where he has advised on the acceptance and inclusion of nontheism in American life.</p><p>Hawkins left the company along with Palm co-founders <a href=#>Donna Dubinsky</a> and <a href=#>Ed Colligan</a> to start Handspring, which debuted the Handspring Visor in September 1999. 3Com ended up spinning off Palm in March 2000, which then merged in a reconfluence with Handspring in August 2003.</p><p>Hawkins searched for partners to build a simple new handheld, but was stymied until modem manufacturer USRobotics stepped in with the financial backing and manufacturing expertise to bring the PalmPilot to market in early 1996. By the fall of 1998, US Robotics' new owner, 3Com, was hindering his plans.</p><p>Hawkins founded Palm Inc. in January 1992. Their first product was the Zoomer, a collaboration with Palm applications, GeoWorks OS, Casio hardware, and Tandy marketing. The Apple Newton came out about the same time, late 1993, but both products failed, partly due to poor character recognition software. Hawkins responded with Graffiti, a simpler and more effective recognition product that ran on both the Zoomer and the Newton. They also developed HotSync synchronization software for Hewlett-Packard devices.</p><p>Hawkins desired to move on with the development of a smaller, hand-held device, but executives at GRiD were reluctant to take the risk. Tandy Corporation had acquired GRiD in 1988, and they were willing to support Hawkins in a new venture company.</p><p>Hawkins' interest in pattern recognition for speech and text input to computers led him to enroll in the biophysics program at the University of California, Berkeley in 1986. While there he patented a "pattern classifier" for handwritten text, but his PhD proposal was rejected, apparently because none of the professors there were working in that field. The setback led him back to GRiD, where, as vice president of research, he developed their pen-based computing initiative that in 1989 spawned the GRiDPad, one of the first tablet computers.</p><p>Hawkins moved to GRiD Systems in 1982, where he developed rapid application development (RAD) software called GRiDtask.</p><p>He attended Cornell University, where he received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1979, then started work for Intel.</p><p>After graduating from Cornell in June 1979, he read a special issue of Scientific American on the brain in which Francis Crick lamented the lack of a grand theory explaining how the brain functions. Initially, Hawkins attempted to join the MIT AI Lab but was refused.</p><p><a href=#>Jeffrey Hawkins</a> (born June 1, 1957) is the American founder of Palm Computing and Handspring where he invented the PalmPilot and Treo, respectively. He has since turned to work on neuroscience full-time, founding the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience (formerly the Redwood Neuroscience Institute) in 2002 and Numenta in 2005. Hawkins is the author of On Intelligence which explains his memory-prediction framework theory of the brain.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfn7KnsoyhmLCjmaPA</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jeffrey-earnhardt-wife-is-the-car-racing-driver-married-details-on-his-relationship-status-282489-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeffrey Earnhardt Wife Is The Car Racing Driver Married?
