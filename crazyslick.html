Many other streamers who had experienced the same thing while hanging out with Slick backed up her claim in a tweet that she had been sexually assaulted by Slick.</p><p>AdrianahLee gathered testimonies from other Twitch girls that experienced similar problems. These collected statements were published on her Twitter page. Mr. Slick deleted his social media accounts once the scandal started, and he hasn’t been seen since.</p><p>On September 20, 2022, Slick discovered this after having his accounts deactivated.
