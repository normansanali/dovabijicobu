Entertainers have world-renowned fame, lavish lifestyles, and the ability to connect with like-minded individuals. That said, celebrities are people just like us and tend to go through similar situations. Case in point: dealing with heartbreak.</p><p>Actor <a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> is one of Hollywood’s A-listers and was once an eligible bachelorette. However, navigating the dating field in Hollywood is a major risk that can leave you heartbroken or blissfully in love.</p><p>Like most folks, Gwyneth has seen her share of heartbreak — specifically, during her relationship with <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a> — but she’s since been able to bounce back.</p><p>Now that folks are relating to Gwyneth’s failed relationship with Brad, it’s only right we take a deep dive into the Goop founder’s relationship history.</p><p>Here’s the tea.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@gwynethpaltrow</a><p>Donovan Leitch and Gwyneth Paltrow in 1992 (per Gwyneth's Instagram caption)</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gwyneth Paltrow first dated multi-hyphenate Donovan Leitch.</h2><p>Gwyneth dated actor, model, and singer, Donovan Leitch. The pair reportedly dated from 1993 to 1995.</p><p>Interestingly, the ex-lovers were spotted engaging in some PDA at a Sept. 2013 L.A. Dodgers game. However, Donovan shared that their kiss was purely innocent.</p><p>“I was just saying goodbye to her,” Donovan told the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> DailyMail</a>. “It was purely innocent. We were sitting in the owner’s box in front of 30,000 people with her two children right next to us. That isn’t exactly the setting for a secret liaison.”</p><p>Donovan also shared that he and Gwyneth are close friends and that they “have tons of great friends in common.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gwyneth quietly dated ‘House’ star Robert Sean Leonard.</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a> confirms that Gwyneth and Robert Sean Leonard briefly dated in 1994.</p><p>Although Gwyneth has never spoken out about her time with Robert, the House star did shed some light on their breakup.</p><p>“It was the funniest breakup I've ever had," Robert told the New York Post in 1998 via E! News. "We were in her apartment, figured we shouldn't see each other anymore, and within five minutes she was saying, 'You know who you'd like? I have this friend ... Gwyneth's a bit of a yenta, but she's a great, great friend."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gwyneth then moved on to Brad Pitt.</h2><p>Long before <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> or <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> came into the picture, Gwyneth Paltrow was Brad Pitt’s main squeeze.</p><p>The pair dated in the mid-to-late-‘90s and seemed very much in love with each other. After two years of dating, the pair got engaged in December 1996 but split six months later.</p><p>"I had a lot of development to do, looking back in hindsight, " Gwyneth told Call Her Daddy podcast host <a href=#>Alex Cooper</a> in the May 2, 2023 episode. “In a lot of ways, I didn't really fully start to come into myself until I was 40 years old. And I had such a pleasing issue. I didn't really even understand how to listen to my instincts and act from that place for what was right for me. I was always trying to adjudicate what was right for everyone else."</p><p>Gwyneth also shared that she experienced the “major, major love at first sight” feeling with Brad and said that she was “totally heartbroken” when they separated.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gwyneth went on to have an on-again, off-again relationship with Ben Affleck.</h2><p>Gwyneth and Ben dated from 1997 to 2000 with an on-again, off-again relationship dynamic. It appears that their relationship was irreparable due to Ben dealing with certain issues.</p><p>“Ben makes life tough for himself," Gwyneth told Diane Sawyer in 2003, per E! News.</p><p>"He's got a lot of complications, and you know, he really is a great guy. So I hope he sorts himself out."
