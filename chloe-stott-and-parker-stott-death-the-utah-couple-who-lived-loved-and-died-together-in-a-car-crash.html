Chloe and their unborn baby boy died on the spot, while Parker succumbed to his injuries four days later at a hospital. The couple, who co-owned a boutique spa in Lindon, Utah, had been married for three years and were looking forward to becoming parents.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Accident></span>The Accident<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to the Arizona Department of Public Safety, the accident occurred around 8:20 p.m. on southbound U.S. 93 in Wickenburg, Arizona. The couple were driving a Toyota truck and were passing other vehicles in a legal passing zone, but failed to complete the maneuver around the last car in their lane. They collided head-on with a Volvo commercial truck that was traveling northbound. Chloe Stott, who was sitting in the passenger seat, was killed on impact, along with their unborn son, who was about 10 weeks old. Parker Stott, who was driving, was flown to the Arizona Burn Center, where he underwent three surgeries for his severe burns and other injuries.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Chloe_Stott_and_Parker_Stott_Obituary_and_Death></span>Chloe Stott and Parker Stott Obituary and Death<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The news of the couple’s death shocked and saddened their families, friends, and community. They described them as loving, kind, hardworking, and adventurous people who had a bright future ahead of them. They also said that they were overjoyed to find out that they were expecting a baby and were planning to surprise their relatives with the announcement on Christmas.</p><p>A friend of the couple, Jake Toolson, set up a GoFundMe page to help with the medical and funeral expenses. The page raised more than $200,000 from over 4,400 donors in less than a week. Toolson wrote on the page: “They had just found out they were pregnant with a baby and were so excited to be parents and share the news with their loved ones over Christmas. At 8:30 pm Wednesday they were involved in a tragic car accident that took the life of Chloe Stott and their precious baby boy.”</p><p>The couple’s families also shared their grief and gratitude on social media. On Saturday, Dec. 24, they posted an update on Parker Stott’s condition, saying that his injuries were more extensive than they thought and that his outlook was extremely bleak. They said that they gathered around him as a family, kissed him, hugged him, held his hand, and told him how much they loved him and how proud they were of him. They said that he passed away at 6:47 p.m., joining his wife and son in heaven.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Husband of pregnant influencer Chloe Stott dies days after horror crash as couple was driving to Arizona for Christmas to surprise their family with news of a baby <a href=#>https://t.co/xkbQPMWJGn</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/VJKQmIutH0</a></p>— Daily Mail Online (@MailOnline) <a href=# rel=noopener>December 24, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Legacy></span>The Legacy<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chloe Stott and Parker Stott left behind a legacy of love, service, and entrepreneurship. They met at Utah Valley University, where they both studied business. They fell in love and got married in 2020. They shared a passion for travel, adventure, and wellness. They opened Clover Skin Bar, a small business that offered skin care services and products, in 2022. They quickly gained a loyal clientele and a reputation for excellence. They also supported other local businesses and charities in their community.</p><p>Chloe was described as a beautiful, smart, and talented woman who had a radiant smile and a bubbly personality. She loved animals, nature, and music. She was also a devout member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and served a mission in Brazil. She had a dream of becoming a mother and was thrilled to learn that she was pregnant.</p><p>Parker was described as a strong, brave, and generous man who had a great sense of humor and a zest for life. He loved sports, cars, and video games. He was also a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and served a mission in Mexico. He had a vision of growing his business and providing for his family. He was devoted to his wife and was excited to become a father.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Conclusion></span>Conclusion<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The tragic deaths of Chloe Stott and Parker Stott have touched the hearts of many people who knew them or heard their stories. They were a young couple who had everything to live for but lost it all in a split second. They were a couple who had a lot to give, but never got the chance to do so. They were a couple who had a lot to celebrate, but never got to share it with their loved ones. They were a couple who had a lot of love but left it behind too soon.</p><p>As we mourn their loss and honor their memory, let us remember their example of living life to the fullest, loving each other unconditionally, and trusting in God’s plan. Let us also remember their words of wisdom, which they posted on their Instagram account shortly before their accident: “Life is short. Live it. Love is rare. Grab it. Anger is bad. Dump it. Fear is awful. Face it. Memories are sweet. Cherish them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrKynspmle6S7zGimm6Gkqq6zxY6cn6WnlWLAtbvTrWSappRivaK%2Byp6pZqukpMG1ecOemK2gXam1pnnUrZihZZOkwrG4xGauoaddoba3scNmo6iulZl6orrDZpuinZRiwbCzxK2fnqpdnrturYycmKtlk6eutLSO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-are-the-two-trees-of-valinor-in-the-rings-of-power.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What are the Two Trees of Valinor in The Rings of Power?">&larr;
