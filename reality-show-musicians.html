Take <strong>Carrie Underwood</strong>, for instance: Before Idol, this Oklahoman was <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>on track to become a journalist</a>. And <strong>Zayn Malik</strong> has said that before he became part of One Direction on The X Factor, he had <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>plans to pursue a teaching career</a>. Curious which other artists wouldn't be where they are without <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>reality TV</a>? From <strong>Beyoncé </strong>to <strong>Britney Spears</strong>, these are some of the most successful musicians who got their starts on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>reality shows</a>. And for more Hollywood origin stories, check out the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>23 Actors You Didn't Realize Have Famous Parents</a>.</p><p>Long before she was winning Grammys or dating <strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Alanis</strong> <strong>Morissette</strong>—AKA Alanis Nadine—was <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>competing as an unknown 14-year-old</a> on&nbsp;Star Search in 1990. She didn't win, but she did <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>go on to sell 60 million albums worldwide</a>, so she may very well be one of the most successful losers of all time. And for more nostalgia from the era in which Alanis reined supreme, here are <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>50 Things Only People Who Lived in the 1990s Will Remember</a>.</p><p>In 1992, even before she starred on The Mickey Mouse Club, 10-year-old <strong>Britney Spears</strong> was also <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>a contestant on Star Search</a>. She lost in the second round of the show to a young singer named <strong>Marty Thomas</strong>, but that didn't stop her from becoming one of the best-selling artists of all time. <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>On the&nbsp;Billboard Hot 100</a>, she's had five No. 1 hits and 13 total songs reach the top 10. Yeah… Marty who? And if you remember when Spears released her first album, then here are <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>19 Things That Happened in 1999 That Will Make You Feel So Old</a>.</p><p>It's hard not to recognize the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>raw and natural talent</a> of <strong>Christina Aguilera&nbsp;</strong>whenever she belts out a high note. But somehow, in 1990, when she was also on Star Search, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>nine-year-old Aguilera</a>&nbsp;lost to a 12-year-old by the name of <strong>Christopher Eason</strong>.</p><p>"I was a good sport about it. My mom made me go back out and shake his hand and tell him I was happy he won. Tears were running down my face," Aguilera told <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Rolling Stone</a> in 1999. But, as the magazine put it, Aguilera "lost the battle but won the war."</p><p>The 2005 BET show <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Blowin' Up Fatty Koo</a>&nbsp;invited up-and-coming artists to compete for a spot in the now-defunct band Fatty Koo, and one of the singers who tried out for a spot was none other than <strong>Miguel</strong>. Shockingly, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Grammy-winning</a> R&B artist was told he couldn't sing by Fatty Koo member <strong>Valure</strong>, who <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>later clarified</a>, "I never said Miguel couldn't sing. … All I said was, 'He got a nice voice, but some of them notes was flat' … I stand behind what I said." Haters gonna hate! And for more on celebrities who didn't immediately find success, here are <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>40 World-Famous A-Listers Who Didn't Become Famous Until After 40</a>.</p><p>When&nbsp;<strong>Jennifer Hudson&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>competed on the third season of American Idol</a> in 2004, she only came in seventh place. However, that didn't stop this soulful singer from rising to the top. Two years after her stint on the show, she made her film debut in Dreamgirls—and for that performance, she received an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, a BAFTA, and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Since then,&nbsp;she's <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>starred on Broadway</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>won Grammys</a>, and even <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>earned a star</a> on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><p>She might be one of the hottest country artists today, but back in 2003,&nbsp;<strong>Miranda Lambert</strong> was just another contestant on the very first season of&nbsp;Nashville Star. For her audition, she performed an original song called "<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Greyhound Bound for Nowhere</a>," and her country chops eventually earned her third place in the inaugural competition.</p><p>In 1993, a 12-year-old&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><strong>Beyoncé&nbsp;</strong>appeared on&nbsp;Star Search</a> as a member of Girl's Tyme, as did <strong>Kelly Rowland</strong>. And though the girl group lost to a band called Skeleton Crew, this early setback was merely a bump in the road to superstardom. By 1996, Girl's Tyme had lost some members, gained some more, and changed their name to Destiny's Child. Then, in 2000, they <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>won their first Grammy</a> for "Say My Name."</p><p>In 2005, the then-members of Destiny's Child—Knowles, Rowland, and <strong>Michelle Williams</strong>—went their separate ways, but that was only the beginning for Beyoncé. As a solo artist, she's sold <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>more than 100 million records worldwide</a> and in 2019, she was named <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>one of the richest female musicians</a> in the world. And for more groups who went on break and never reformed, here are <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>The Bands That Went on a "Hiatus" But Have Yet To Come Back</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/usher.jpg><p>In 1991, 13-year-old <strong>Usher Raymond IV </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>won Best Teen Vocalist on&nbsp;Star Search</a>. Though he released his debut self-titled album a few years later, his real rise to fame came with his second album,&nbsp;My Way, in 1997. It included the No. 1 hit—"Nice & Slow"—and two No. 2 hits—the title track and "You Make Me Wanna…" To date, the R&B singer and Voice coach has nine&nbsp;No. 1 singles <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>on the Hot 100</a> and 18 total top 10 hits. Unfortunately, no videos exist online of Usher's performance from nearly 30 years ago, but we can only imagine how adorable the young R&B singer must've been.</p><p>Though they finished in third place on the second season of The X Factor in 2012, Fifth Harmony is arguably the reality competition's biggest success U.S. story. And out of the five fierce females that made up the group, "Señorita" singer <strong>Camila Cabello</strong>&nbsp;has undoubtedly seen the most success as a solo artist. To date, she's had two No. 1 hits, four songs in the top 10, and 14 charting songs total on the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Billboard Hot 100</a>. And for more on musicians who used to be in bands, check out these <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>13 Successful Solo Acts Who Surprisingly Started Out in a Group</a>.</p><p>In 2010, a young and unknown&nbsp;<strong>Harry Styles</strong> was <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>quickly eliminated</a> from the British version of The X Factor. The singer got a second <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>chance at fame</a>, however, when the show decided to bring him back as part of the boy band One Direction. The band finished in third place, subsequently signed with <strong>Simon Cowell's&nbsp;</strong>Syco Entertainment, and became The Beatles of the 2000s.</p><p>But when One Direction went on an <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>indefinite hiatus</a> in 2016, Styles embarked on a solo career that thus far has produced <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>a top 5 single</a>, a <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>record-breaking sold-out world tour</a>, and a part in an Oscar-winning movie (Dunkirk) to boot.</p><p>Another One Direction member who has seen quite a bit of solo success is<strong> Zayn Malik</strong>. This <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>former X Factor&nbsp;contestant</a> has had <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>seven charting singles</a> from just two albums—and his muse for several years was none other than <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>supermodel&nbsp;<strong>Gigi Hadid</strong></a>, another reality TV alum (via her mom's run on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills).</p><p>In 2006, <strong>Leona Lewis</strong>&nbsp;became the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>third winner</a> of the British version of&nbsp;The X Factor. The following year, she released her debut album, Spirit, which quickly became the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>fastest-selling debut album</a> in U.K. history upon its release. Over in the U.S., she has had five songs <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>on the Billboard Hot 100</a>: "Better in Time," "Happy," "I Will Be," "Run," and her No.1 hit, "Bleeding Love."</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Khsc-vH2wbs</p><p>Many former American Idol winners have gone on to have <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>subpar and insignificant careers</a>. Not <strong>Carrie Underwood</strong>, though. In 2005, upon <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>winning the fourth season of the hit show</a>, the country crooner released "Inside Your Heaven," which debuted at No. 1 on the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Billboard Hot 100</a>. And with the release of her sixth album, Cry Pretty, in 2018, Underwood became the first and only artist in history to have <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>seven consecutive No. 1 releases</a> on Billboard's&nbsp;Top Country Albums chart. (In addition to her six studio albums, she also released a chart-topping hits package in 2014.)</p><p>In 1993, 11-year-old <strong>Justin Timberlake</strong>—then known as Justin Randall—<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>appeared on Star Search</a>&nbsp;in hopes of becoming a country music star. His audition song of choice? <strong>Alan Jackson's&nbsp;</strong>"Love's Got a Hold On You," of course!</p><p>He didn't leave the show a winner, but no matter: Timberlake made his mark a few years later as a member of *NSYNC, one of the most popular boy bands of the era. An, as a solo artist, Timberlake has had five No. 1 songs <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>on the Hot 100 chart</a> and 19 total top 10 hits.</p><p><strong>Jordin Sparks</strong>, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>winner of American Idol's sixth season</a>, was the youngest winner in the show's history at just 16. Now, at 29 years old, she's had three songs <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>on the Billboard Hot 100's top 10</a>, has <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>done several stints on Broadway</a>, and has even been <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>nominated for a Grammy</a>.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>On the eighth season of American Idol, pop-rock performer <strong>Adam Lambert&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>came in second place</a> after Arkansas native <strong>Kris Allen</strong>. If you're measuring by post-show success, though, Lambert is the real winner through and through. With his 2009 debut album For Your Entertainment, Lambert became a <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Billboard chart-topping success</a> and he even earned a <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Grammy nomination</a>. Not long after, the Idol alum found even more international success when he collaborated with the active members of Queen to create Queen + Adam Lambert.</p><p>After <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>winning the very first season of American Idol</a> in 2002,&nbsp;<strong>Kelly Clarkson</strong> went on to release "A Moment Like This," which ultimately became <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>that year's best-selling single</a>. And that was far from this fierce Texan's only hit: To date, the singer has had 27 songs <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>on the&nbsp;Billboard Hot 100</a>, three of which have reached the No. 1 spot. In 2019, Clarkson's <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>"Meaning of Life" tour</a> grossed more than $17.5 million with more than 275,000 tickets sold. Now, she even has her own daytime TV show. She proves Idol's first choice was their best choice.</p><p>Before she was a judge on shows like The Sing-Off and&nbsp;The X Factor,&nbsp;<strong>Nicole Scherzinger</strong> was herself a contestant on a reality competition series. In the early aughts, she was paired with four other musicians <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>on the American iteration of Popstars</a>, and together, the five winners of the competition became Eden's Crush.</p><p>Though this girl group was short-lived, Scherzinger was able to stay in the spotlight by becoming the face of another group: the Pussycat Dolls. In the six years they were active, Scherzinger and the band <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>sold 54 million records worldwide</a> and had four songs among the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Billboard Hot 100's</a> top 10. She even went on to voice a character in Disney's&nbsp;Moana&nbsp;and currently serves as a judge on&nbsp;The Masked Singer, sticking to her reality TV roots.</p><p>Ever since she <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>finished in fourth place</a> on&nbsp;The X Factor,&nbsp;<strong>Cher Lloyd&nbsp;</strong>has been a fierce force to be reckoned with in the music industry. And though she still hasn't achieved a top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100—her <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>highest-charting single to date</a> is "Want U Back" at No. 12—she's collaborated with big-name artists like <strong>Demi Lovato</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Becky G</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Ne-Yo</strong>, <strong>T.I.</strong>, <strong>Busta Rhymes</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Juicy J</strong>.</p><p>In 1989,&nbsp;<strong>Aaliyah Haughton</strong>, then just 10 years old, competed on Star Search in the Junior Vocalist category. Her performance of "<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>My Funny Valentine</a>" didn't earn her a win on the show, but it was enough to secure her a contract with Jive Records just a few years later. Though she tragically died in a plane crash at the age of 22, Aaliyah still managed to have five top 10 hits <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>on the Hot 100 chart</a> during her career, which ended far too soon.
