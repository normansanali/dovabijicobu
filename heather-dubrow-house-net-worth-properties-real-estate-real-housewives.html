The actress/reality star has once claimed that <a href=#>her involvement with the show has been detrimental to her acting career</a>. In recent years, however, it seems that Dubrow has had a change of heart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>From 'Housewives' To Hand Sanitizer, Heather Dubrow Chooses To Charge Instead Of Donate</a></span></p><p>And while fans are waiting to see Dubrow’s return to the show, they can certainly follow her on social media to see what the mother of four is up to these days. After all, Dubrow is never too shy to share snippets of her life. In fact, she’s readily shared photos from her lavish homes. And to this day, fans are still guessing how much Dubrow and her husband, Dr. Terry Dubrow, have spent on real estate so far.</p><h2 id=who-is-heather-dubrow>Who Is Heather Dubrow?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dubrow had been working in Hollywood long before reality television took off. In fact, the reality star started out in the 90s, taking on roles in shows such as Baby Talk, Married… with Children, Nowhere Man, and Men Behaving Badly. Later on, Dubrow also landed a regular role in the comedy Stark Raving Mad, which was headlined by Tony Shalhoub and a younger Neil Patrick Harris.</p><p>Over the years, Dubrow would also take on a couple of film projects, particularly the 2002 movies Now You Know and The First $20 Million Is Always the Hardest. Throughout her career, the actress kept busy with television, landing the lead role in the drama comedy That’s Life. Dubrow also had guest roles in Malibu Country, Hot in Cleveland, Hawaii Five-0, and Young & Hungry. She was also cast in the 2014 thriller Sequestered.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'RHOC' Heather Dubrow Gets The Sweetest Message From Husband, Dr. Terry</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, when the opportunity to came to star in a reality show, Dubrow decided to star in The Real Housewives of Orange County after being persuaded by her husband. “He’s been on a couple of reality shows himself, Bridalplasty on E!, The Swan on Fox, amongst others, and he’s very comfortable in that genre,” she told The Hollywood Reporter. “He basically didn’t talk to me for two weeks until I said I’d do it. That’s actually a true story. It’s a great platform, I mean, I don’t know, I guess if you ask me if I think it’s a good idea if I did this show, ask me in four months. But I think in general, it was an opportunity, Terry and I discussed it, and we decided that the pros outweighed the cons.”</p><h2 id=heather-dubrow-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-around-50-million>Heather Dubrow’s Net Worth Is Around $50 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dubrow may not have been an A-list star at the height of her acting career but it’s safe to say that she got paid quite nicely for her work. Meanwhile, during her past stint on the Real Housewives franchise, it is believed that the former actress got paid $300,000 per season.</p><p>Just before she was about to end her reality tv stint, Dubrow also ventured into podcasting with Heather Dubrow’s World. “I used to talk a lot about my life, and then I did a lot of guests, and then I sort of married all of the things,”<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> she told Nicki Swift</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Heather Dubrow Celebrates Kids' 17th Birthday With Adorable Video</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In such a short time, Dubrow’s podcast became a huge hit. “The response is great. I mean, like I said, when I started it, I got all of the Housewife audience, and it's really grown so much since then,” the actress/reality star remarked. “And I feel like I've created this community that is amazing, and I feel like we know each other. We share stuff, and I love when I can share something about my life.” With her hit podcasts and all her other projects, Dubrow is estimated to be worth a cool $50 million.</p><h2 id=here-rsquo-s-how-much-heather-dubrow-has-spent-on-her-properties>Here’s How Much Heather Dubrow Has Spent On Her Properties</h2><p>For Dubrow and her husband, buying homes is almost like a hobby. In fact, in a span of 22 years, the couple and their family have lived in as many as 18 residences. For Dubrow, it’s never just about adding another property to their ever-growing real estate portfolio. Rather, it’s essentially a design project that she can get extremely passionate about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while the figures aren’t readily available for all of the Dubrow’s lavish digs, it is believed that the 22,000-square-foot Dubrow Chateau is worth a jaw-dropping $21 million. It’s a home that Dubrow is incredibly proud of because she took charge of the design herself. “I can hype this house as much as I want,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told Architectural Digest</a>. “It’s going to live up to that hype. It’s going to exceed that hype.” The majestic home boasts of features such as a 21-seat movie theater, a champagne wall, an entire hall for pinball.</p><p>Back in 2020, it was revealed that Dubrow and her husband had purchased a land in Idaho. As expected, the couple looks to build a new home for their family there and as expected, Dubrow herself is taking point on the design. She also knows what type of home the lot needs. “So I had this lake house fantasy and I dragged Terry there, leather jacket and all, which he never took off the entire time in the summer at the lake,” she explained during an appearance on Realitea with Derek Z. “And I fell in love and I'm designing a house right now.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while it is currently unclear how much the couple is spending on their new property, fans can be sure that for the latest Dubrow home, the sky’s the limit.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Heather Dubrow's Kids Share Adorable Tributes In Honor Of Her Birthday</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnpmknbKzecOumaunp2K1sMHSnmSnnaRixLC%2B06FkqaqfpbKzwMieqmaqlZa5brHSrZitnV2nsqK4jKGmrquVrLa3sdJo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hailey-bieber-defended-selena-gomez-instagram-like-comment.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Hailey Bieber Defended Selena Gomez on Instagram">&larr;
