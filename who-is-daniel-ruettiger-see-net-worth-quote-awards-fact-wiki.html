He is also known for being a former college football player, who played for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish team.</p><p>So, have you ever wondered how rich Daniel Ruettiger is, as of late 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that the total size of Daniel’s net worth is over $500,000, accumulated largely through his career as a motivational speaker. Another source is coming from the film about his early life and football career.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=daniel-ruettiger-net-worth-500000></span>Daniel Ruettiger Net Worth $500,000<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Daniel Ruettiger spent his childhood with thirteen siblings in his hometown. As he was dyslexic, he had a lot of problems in school, but despite this difficulty, while attending Joliet Catholic High School, he started playing football under the coach Gordie Gillespie. Upon matriculation, he served in the US Navy as a yeoman for two years. When he returned home, Daniel enrolled at Holy Cross College.</p><p>Two years later, he transferred to the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, where he continued playing football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team, although he was undersized. Soon, he became a part of the Notre Dame scout team; however, his first game was his last, as he sacked the quarterback, after which he was carried off the field by his teammates. Twenty years later, David Anspaugh made the film about Daniel’s early life and career entitled “Rudy” (1993), in which he was portrayed by Sean Astin, adding a considerable amount to his net worth.</p><p>Afterwards, Daniel began to pursue his career as a motivational speaker, addressing teenagers in school, college students and professional athletes. In no time, thanks to his unique communication skills and enthusiasm, he became known for his powerful message of “YES I CAN”. As he distinguished himself as a motivational speaker, Daniel has appeared in a number of television talk shows and radio shows, increasing his net worth by a large margin.</p><p>To speak further about his career, Daniel also published several books – “Rudy’s Insights For Winning In Life”, “Rudy’s Lessons For Young Champions”, and “Rudy & Friends” – all of which contributed considerably to his fortune.</p><p>When it comes to speak about his personal life, Daniel Ruettiger has been married to Cheryl since 1975; the couple has two children together, and they reside in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><p>Most recently, Daniel established his own charitable organization called the Rudy Foundation, and thanks to his accomplishments, he won a number of significant awards, including the Distinguished American Award, an Honorary Doctorate Degree from Our Lady of Holy Cross College, and he was also inducted into the Speakers Hall of Fame. In January 2017, Daniel became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Rudy</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$500,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 22, 1948</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Joliet, Illinois USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.68 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>75&nbsp;kg, 75&nbsp;kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Motivational speaker</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Joliet Catholic Academy, University of Notre Dame, Holy Cross College</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Cheryl Ruettiger</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Jessica Noel Ruettiger, Daniel Joseph Ruettiger</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Belly Ruettiger, Daniel Eugene Ruettiger, Sr.</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Tim Ruettiger, Mark Ruettiger, Carol Surges, John Ruettiger, Jean Ann Voelker, Francis Ruettiger, Rosemarie Haiduke, Norma Berman, Mickey Ruettiger, Bernie Ruettiger, Mary Eileen Brockup, Elizabeth Gallo, Rita Hasanaj</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>http://www.facebook.com/RudyInternational</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0749214/</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Is a inspirational (not motivational) speaker.
