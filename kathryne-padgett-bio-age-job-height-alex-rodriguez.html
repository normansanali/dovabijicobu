But in 2022, she shot to the international limelight not because of her profession but rather for vacationing out with the former professional baseball shortstop/businessman Alex Rodriguez.</span></p><p><span>This Kathryne Padgett Bio explores her life.</span></p><h3><b>Alex Rodriguez And Kathryne Padgett Dating?</b></h3><p><span>No, Kathryne Padgett and Alex Rodriguez weren’t dating.</span></p><p><span>“A-Rod is single and enjoying life,” an insider shed light on their alleged relationship.“It’s not like she’s his girlfriend. They went to Green Bay and then to Minnesota. She’s not his girlfriend. He is a single dude,” he added.</span></p><p><span>Even Kathryne’s FB labeled her to be “single” then.</span></p><p><span>Kathryne, first made headlines on Jan 22, 2022, after she was spotted freezing in the stands of Lambeau Field with the baseball star. It seems that the duo chose the&nbsp; freezing weather instead of cozying of in a heated room because Alex “wanted to experience Lambeau Field in the stands.”</span></p><p><span>However, that wasn’t their first sighting.</span></p><p><span>The pair was previously spotted on the 50-yard line at the Packers game, both wearing the yellow Packers hats.

That night, Kathryne even took it to her IG to post pics from the court flaunting black leggings, and a black leather jacket.</span></p><p><span>Apart from the sightings, Kathryne and Alex also have reportedly vacationed in Miami. What more confirms this rumor is Kathryne’s IG pic from the Florida city taken on a boat that looks similar to Rodriguez’s.</span></p><p><span>But this might just be one of Alex’s flings. After the star’s split with Jennifer Lopez in April 2021, he was also spotted with reporter Melanie Collins vacationing in St. Tropez and Ibiza, Spain.</span></p><p><span>Also, there were rumors that Alex was linked to the </span><i><span>Southern Charm</span></i><span> star Madison LeCroy.</span></p><p><span>Alex has dated many high-profile celebrities over the years.
