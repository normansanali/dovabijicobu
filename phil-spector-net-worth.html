He produced some of the biggest hits of the 1960s, including “Unchained Melody” and “You’ve Lost That Loving Feeling” for the Righteous Brothers. These songs alone generated over $100 million in royalties for Spector, the songwriters, and the artists. Spector also produced The Beatles’ album “Let It Be” and John Lennon’s most notable solo work.</p><p>Despite his contributions to music, Spector’s reputation was tarnished when he was convicted of the 2003 murder of actress Lana Clarkson. He died in prison in 2021 while serving a life sentence. Nevertheless, Spector’s legacy as a revolutionary and influential figure in modern music remains intact. He helped integrate modern pop music with studio production elements and effectively made the recording process into another instrument within a band. In 1989, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and almost a decade later, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_of_Phil_Spector>Early Life of Phil Spector</span></h2><p>Phil Spector was born on December 26, 1939, in The Bronx, New York. He was raised in a Jewish household and faced a tragedy at a young age when his father committed suicide. Phil’s mother worked as a seamstress to support the family. During high school, he learned how to play the guitar and formed his first band, The Teddy Bears.</p><h2><span id=Phil_Spectors_Career_Highlights>Phil Spector’s Career Highlights</span></h2><p>Phil Spector began his career as a member of the Teddy Bears and went on to produce music for various artists throughout the 60s. He achieved massive success in the 70s, producing the Beatles album “Let It Be” and working with individual members of the group for their solo albums. During this period, he created his famous Wall of Sound technique.</p><p>After suffering serious head injuries in a car crash, Spector withdrew from public life and was mostly quiet from the 80s to the early 2000s. He gained further recognition after working with the Ramones and briefly collaborating with Yoko Ono in 1981.</p><h2><span id=The_Controversial_Death_of_Lana_Clarkson>The Controversial Death of Lana Clarkson</span></h2><p>In 2003, Lana Clarkson died from a gunshot wound to the face at Phil Spector’s California mansion. Spector claimed that it was an “accidental suicide,” but his story did not hold up. On the initial 9-11 call, Spector stated “I think I’ve killed someone,” and eyewitnesses reported seeing him walking out of the back door with a gun. Spector paid a $1 million bail and remained a free man until his trial began in 2007.</p><p>The case was declared a mistrial that year due to an indecisive jury. Spector continued with his music career, but was called to a retrial in 2008. This time, the jury reached a guilty verdict and he was sentenced to 19 years to life in prison. Due to his deteriorating health, he spent most of his time in the California Health Care Facility as an inmate.</p><h2><span id=Phil_Spector_Dies_at_81_Due_to_COVID-19_Complications>Phil Spector Dies at 81 Due to COVID-19 Complications</span></h2><p>Phil Spector, the legendary music producer, died on January 16, 2021, at the age of 81. According to reports, his death was due to complications from COVID-19.</p><h2><span id=Phil_Spectors_Controversial_Personal_Life>Phil Spector’s Controversial Personal Life</span></h2><p>In 1963, Spector married Annette Merar, the lead singer of the Spectors Three. He later had an affair with Veronica Bennett (Ronnie Spector) and left Annette to marry her. Ronnie later admitted to being imprisoned and abused by Phil. Their divorce was finalized in 1974, and Ronnie claimed she did not pursue any stake in Phil’s business or custody of their children because he had threatened to have her killed.</p><p>Phil’s children also suffered abuse after their mother left. They alleged being imprisoned within the home and forced to simulate sex acts with his new girlfriend. In the 80s, Phil had two children with his girlfriend Janis Zavala.</p><p>In 2006, Phil married Rachelle Short, a 35-year-old waitress, while awaiting trial for murder. Ten years later, he filed for divorce, claiming Rachelle was wasting his fortune on expensive purchases, including homes for her mother, jewelry, plastic surgery, cars, and a private plane.</p><h2><span id=Spectors_French_Chateau-Style_Residence>Spector’s French Chateau-Style Residence</span></h2><p>Spector’s French chateau-style residence in Alhambra, California, was up for sale with an asking price of $5.5 million. The estate became known as a “beautiful and charming castle,” although local residents detested Phil for making them feel like peasants. The gated estate features 8,700 square feet of living space, crystal chandeliers, and hand-painted wall murals. The property also comes with its own built-in hair salon.</p><p>In August 2020 the price was lowered to $4 million. In January the estate accepted a contingent offer at around $3.98 million.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC8x6KjZqugmrC1u9FmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rob-dahm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rob Dahm">&larr;
