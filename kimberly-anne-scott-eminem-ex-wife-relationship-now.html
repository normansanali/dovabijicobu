It’s hard not to recall their explosive romance given that the Detroit native <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">often penned some not-so-nice lyrics about his ex</a> in his music, where he had called her all sorts of derogatory names.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2000, however, things really escalated when Slim Shady had written a song about his former flame, saying he wanted to kill her, which would later lead to Kim’s attempted suicide after seeing the rap superstar perform the track during one of his concerts. She later sued him for defamation before they’d patch things up and reconcile.</p><p>Throughout their time together, Kim and Eminem shared probably <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared one of the most toxic relationships in Hollywood</a>, and while they clearly weren’t meant to be together, the two have learned to co-exist in each other’s lives for the sake of their 25-year-old daughter, Hailie Jade.</p><h2 id=does-eminem-still-speak-to-kim-mathers>Does Eminem Still Speak To Kim Mathers?</h2><p>Given how private Eminem is with his personal life, it’s unclear whether or not he’s still in contact with his ex-wife, but it’s believed that they still share some sort of a relationship if it pertains to Hailie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2007, Kim <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sat down for a tell-all interview</a> with ABC’s 20/20, where she revealed just how traumatized she had become from the lengthy romance she endured with Eminem, claiming how just thinking about the “Just Lose It” hitmaker made her feel nauseous.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Refuse To Support Ice Cube’s New Music, Still Upset Over His Alliance With Donald Trump</a></span></p><p>Though the mother of three doesn’t like being in the limelight, she seemed comfortable enough to let the world know just how bad things had gotten between her and Eminem, just one year after they had tied the knot for a second time.</p><p>Kim and Em first married in 1999. By 2001, they divorced and decided to call it quits before having a change of heart and deciding to give their romance another try. 2006 brought upon their second time getting hitched, but Kim said the decision to wed Eminem again was a mistake.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Money is great, but it doesn't make your husband stay at home with you,” she said. "Or sleep in the same bed with you … Him being on the road and on tour … that was like the big one. I mean … constant infidelities, all the time,”</p><p>Kim said she first met the Grammy winner during her teenage years and given that they both came from broken homes and troubled families. It wasn’t long after their first encounter at a house party that the two would start dating. But the relationship turned sour within months, and once Eminem, real name Marshall Mathers, became a household name, things only worsened.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Snoop Dogg Teases New Music… And It’s Really Different From What We’re Used To</a></span></p><p>"He would constantly try to belittle me and make me think, like, I should be grateful, basically, that he was with me,” Kim stressed, confessing that her low self-esteem and the need of wanting to feel loved is what also led her to cheat on Eminem.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She concluded her words by saying, "I am not trying to bash Marshall or make him look bad, [I] just, you know, want people to know, I am a person, too. I am trying to move forward with my life."</p><p>Then, in October 2015, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim crashed her Cadillac Escalade in Detroit</a> after she had not only been under the influence of alcohol but a number of pills in yet another suicide attempt.</p><p>She told the Mojo In The Morning radio show that the incident was intentional and that she hoped she wouldn’t survive the near-fatal collision, yet she never explained what drove her to the point of wanting to end her life.</p><p>“Yes, I drank, I took pills and I aimed for a pole,” she shared during the interview. “I did this on purpose, and I’m so sorry. I apologized profusely. I didn’t expect to make it out alive.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick Cannon Dragged For Getting New GF’s Name Tattoo, Despite Having New Baby</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While she didn’t mention her ex as one of the reasons she wanted to commit suicide, Kim expressed that “just because people think we have money,” it didn’t mean she was happy with her life, adding that she’s lost family and friends due to financial disagreements.</p><p>When asked about her relationship with Eminem, she said they were still friends and doing the best they could for the sake of their daughter in the hopes that Hailie can lead a normal life without her parents bickering at one another.</p><p>“We’re just trying to raise our kids together and make it as normal for them as possible.”</p><p>In January 2016, Kim lost her sister Dawn to a drug overdose.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lil Uzi Fans Worry He’ll Be Kidnapped As He Flaunts Pink Forehead Diamond Worth $24M</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiioqWSmr%2BtxYyapaedXaiwsMDTZpymoZ6aum6x12auop6VYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnNqK5o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./eric-bischoff-reveals-rejected-pitch-to-humiliate-him-on-wwe-television.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eric Bischoff Reveals Rejected Pitch To Humiliate Him On WWE Television">&larr;
